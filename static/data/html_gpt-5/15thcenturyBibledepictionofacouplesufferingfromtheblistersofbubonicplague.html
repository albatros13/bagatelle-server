<div>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
This manuscript-style image belongs to the Late Medieval European tradition of biblical illustration. While the specific artist is unknown, the work exemplifies the visual language of Gothic illuminators who synthesized sacred narrative with contemporaneous realities—here, the experience of plague. Workshops in Central or Western Europe often produced such images, combining scriptural episodes with didactic depictions of disease to instruct and admonish viewers.</div>
<br>
<div>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
Created in the fifteenth century, the image emerges after the first catastrophic Black Death pandemic of 1347–1351 and amid recurrent waves that persisted into the 15th century. Ecclesiastical patrons and readers encountered plague not as a singular catastrophe but as a cyclical threat. The manuscript context reflects devotional culture, penitential practices, and the rise of visual exegesis: pictures translating illness into moral and theological lessons while also serving as practical records of symptoms familiar to the audience.</div>
<br>
<div>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
The supine couple marked with rounded lesions presents a visual shorthand for plague. The raised hand of the standing figure—possibly a priest, prophet, or healer—signals intercession, prayer, or the dispersal of fumigants, a common medieval prophylaxis. Beds and pillows situate the scene in domestic sickrooms, indicating contagion’s penetration of private life. The patterned pillows and drapery index the worldly goods vulnerable to miasma or “corrupted air,” while the couple’s exposed torsos emphasize corporeality and vulnerability. The round spots, though not anatomically exact buboes, iconographically index pestilence and divine judgment.</div>
<br>
<div>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
The composition employs strong contour lines, flat color fields, and a shallow spatial stage—hallmarks of Gothic illumination. The clear chromatic contrasts (saturated blue ground; red and green drapery) isolate figures against a decorative void, intensifying the didactic focus on lesions. Rhythm is created by the repetition of circular marks across the bodies, functioning as both pattern and pathology. Drapery folds provide directional lines that lead the eye from the woman to the man, forming a visual dyad of shared affliction. The lack of atmospheric perspective or anatomical modeling foregrounds emblematic meaning over naturalism.</div>
<br>
<div>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
Plague mortality and exposure were shaped by class, occupation, gender, and urban living density. The poor endured crowded housing and limited access to retreat or isolation; women frequently served as caregivers and thus faced heightened risk. Marginalized groups—Jews, foreigners, mendicants, and those labeled “lepers”—were scapegoated, leading to persecution and expulsions. Guild physicians were scarce and expensive, while barber-surgeons and empirics treated the majority. Visual culture both reflected inequity and contributed to it, reinforcing narratives of sin and blame even as it preserved empirical observations of disease.</div>
<br>
<div>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
Bubonic plague is caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis, a zoonosis maintained in rodent reservoirs and transmitted primarily by fleas (notably Xenopsylla cheopis). Following a flea bite, bacteria spread via lymphatics, triggering painful lymphadenitis (buboes) in inguinal, axillary, or cervical nodes. Key virulence determinants include the Pla protease and a Type III secretion system delivering Yop effectors that subvert innate immunity. Without timely therapy, bacteremia may lead to septicemic plague; secondary spread to the lungs produces pneumonic plague capable of person-to-person transmission via droplets.</div>
<br>
<div>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
Clinically, bubonic plague presents with fever, chills, severe malaise, and tender buboes; petechiae and acral necrosis can occur in septicemic forms. Medieval art often stylized lesions as pustules or generalized spots, as seen here. Although not a literal depiction of lymph node swellings, the dotted iconography communicates eruptive illness, contagion, and suffering legible to period viewers. The languid postures, pallor, and bed confinement effectively narrate prostration and systemic toxicity.</div>
<br>
<div>[h] Treatment<br>
Historically, treatments included bloodletting, purgatives, theriac, aromatic fumigation, lancing of buboes, and processions or vows seeking divine mercy; quarantine and pesthouses emerged as public health responses. Modern evidence-based management prioritizes rapid antibiotics—streptomycin or gentamicin; alternatives include doxycycline or ciprofloxacin—plus supportive care, drainage of suppurative buboes, and strict infection control for pneumonic cases. Post-exposure prophylaxis is recommended for close contacts. Vaccines have existed in limited forms; contemporary candidates are under study but not widely deployed.</div>
<br>
<div>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
Transmission risk correlates with rodent ecology, sanitation, crowding, trade networks, conflict-driven displacement, and climate variability affecting flea and rodent populations. Information access and trust in authorities modulate adherence to quarantine or vector control. Economic precarity constrains early care seeking and isolation capacity, while stigmatization of the sick deters disclosure. The artwork’s domestic setting, with two patients sharing bedding, silently comments on how household density and caregiving norms structure exposure.</div>
