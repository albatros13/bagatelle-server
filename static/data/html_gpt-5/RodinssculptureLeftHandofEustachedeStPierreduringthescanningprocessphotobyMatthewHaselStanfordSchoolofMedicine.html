        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Auguste Rodin (1840–1917), the preeminent French sculptor of the late nineteenth century, created a series of fragment studies for his monument The Burghers of Calais. The Left Hand of Eustache de Saint‑Pierre isolates the extremity of the lead burgher, whose moral resolve anchors the ensemble. Rodin’s fascination with hands—as autonomous carriers of psychological force—led him to cast and enlarge hands separately, treating them as expressive portraits.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The hand study derives from Rodin’s work on The Burghers of Calais (conceived 1884–1889; casts thereafter), a civic monument commemorating the 1347 siege of Calais during the Hundred Years’ War. Modeled in the Third Republic, the group engaged republican ideals of shared sacrifice and public virtue. The twenty-first‑century scanning shown here situates the work in a contemporary context of digital humanities and medical visualization, where museums and medical schools collaborate to probe material culture with scientific tools.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The clenched, torqued hand operates as a synecdoche for character: Eustache’s willingness to offer himself for execution is compressed into the flexed digits and taut tendons. The gesture oscillates between supplication and resistance, channeling medieval hagiographic iconography (martyrdom) while prefiguring modern existential tension. As a fragment, the hand also symbolizes labor and the civic body—work, pledge, oath—rendered in bronze permanence.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Rodin’s facture is palpably irregular: thumb pads and dorsal ridges are modeled in swells and gouges, catching light in broken highlights. Contrapposto is translated into micro‑torsion of the wrist; negative spaces between fingers act as apertures that animate the mass. The enlargement of scale relative to a natural hand intensifies expression, while the fragmentary format anticipates modernist autonomy of the part over the whole. Rhythm, emphasis, and texture conspire to externalize interior emotion.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The medieval narrative evokes food scarcity, class burden, and the politicization of sacrifice: prominent citizens were compelled to surrender to protect the populace. Rodin’s nineteenth‑century commission reflects how public monuments often privilege elite narratives even while honoring common suffering. In the biomedical afterlife of the object, inequities persist: access to reconstructive hand surgery, rehabilitation, and advanced imaging remains uneven worldwide. Digitization promises broader educational reach but also depends on institutional resources that are inequitably distributed.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While not diagnostic, the sculpture’s flexed ring and little fingers and the apparent palmar tension invite comparison with conditions affecting the ulnar‑sided hand. Dupuytren’s contracture—an idiopathic fibroproliferative disease of the palmar fascia—causes progressive flexion deformity of metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, typically in men of Northern European ancestry and in association with diabetes, tobacco use, and alcohol. Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow or Guyon’s canal can produce “clawing” due to intrinsic muscle weakness. Volkmann ischemic contracture, following forearm compartment syndrome, and rheumatoid synovitis can also result in fixed flexion postures. These etiologies span mechanical, vascular, inflammatory, and neurogenic origins.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In clinical observation, signs suggestive of the above include palpable palmar cords (Dupuytren), hyperextension at MCP with flexion at IP joints (ulnar claw), intrinsic minus posture, and dorsal knuckle atrophy. The sculpted surface accentuates extensor compartments and the dorsal veins, while the scanned overlays of bones, flexor tendons, and neurovascular bundles visually map the median and ulnar nerve trajectories and the radial/ulnar arterial arches. Such visualization teaches the spatial logic of pathology: why ulnar lesions spare median‑innervated thenar function, or how fascial cords pull specific digits into contracture.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment is etiology‑specific. Dupuytren management ranges from collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection and percutaneous needle aponeurotomy to limited fasciectomy, followed by splinting and hand therapy to minimize recurrence. Ulnar neuropathy may require activity modification, splinting, or surgical decompression/transposition. Inflammatory arthropathies benefit from disease‑modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics; ischemic contractures demand urgent fasciotomy acutely and later reconstructive procedures. Digital models from high‑resolution scans aid preoperative planning, resident education, and patient communication.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Manual labor, vibration exposure, and repetitive grip intensify hand pathology risks; tobacco and alcohol exacerbate Dupuytren’s progression. Access to early diagnosis, ergonomic workplaces, and postoperative therapy is stratified by income, insurance, and proximity to specialty care. Historical siege conditions—malnutrition, infection, and cold—underscore how conflict and deprivation shape the hand’s vulnerabilities. Today, disability from untreated hand disease disproportionately affects workers whose livelihoods depend on fine motor function.</p>
