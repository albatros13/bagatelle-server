        <h1>Statuette of an Old Woman with Parkinson’s Disease (1895)</h1>
        <p><em>Paul Marie Louis Pierre Richer</em></p>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Paul Richer (1849–1933) was a French physician-anatomist, sculptor, and professor at the École des Beaux-Arts, closely associated with the Salpêtrière under Jean-Martin Charcot. Trained in both medicine and art, he advanced a rigorously observational approach, using sculptural practice to codify “pathological types.” Richer’s drawings, casts, and bronzes bridged clinical neurology and academic sculpture, making him a pivotal figure in fin-de-siècle “medico-artistic” discourse. His work popularized precise anatomical depiction, while also influencing artists who sought empirical realism in the body’s form and movement.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 1895, this statuette belongs to the Third Republic era in France, a period enamored with science, classification, and photographic documentation. At the Salpêtrière, Charcot’s clinic became a theater of neurology, where patients’ bodies were catalogued to define new disease entities. Artistic culture absorbed these scientific ideals: realism and naturalism privileged careful observation, while museums and salons valued didactic objects. Richer’s sculpture reflects the era’s confidence in objectivity—yet it also documents the hospital’s asymmetrical relationships between physicians, artists, and largely working-class patients. The work demonstrates how medicine, art academies, and emerging neurology collaborated to produce authoritative visual taxonomies of illness.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>Although explicitly documentary, the figure’s iconography conveys layered meanings. The forward-flexed trunk, bent knees, and the hand poised near the abdomen evoke the classic “resting tremor” stance associated with Parkinsonian bradykinesia and rigidity. The near-nudity emphasizes vulnerability and the stripping away of social identity; the body becomes the bearer of a diagnosis. The aged visage—lips pressed, eyes intent—suggests hypomimia (masked facies), a sign that doubles as a metaphor for the silencing of the ill within institutional settings. In presenting the subject without adornment or narrative, Richer invites viewers to read pathology as both clinical sign and human condition.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Richer’s modeling is taut and economical, with planar surfaces that catch raking light to articulate atrophy and bony landmarks. The figure’s rhythm is downward and anterior, exchanging classical contrapposto for a chain of flexions at the spine, hips, knees, and ankles. Proportion remains naturalistic, but the emphasis on contour and weight shift foregrounds kinesis impaired—motion imagined yet resisted. Texture differentiates tense muscle groups from lax skin, while balance is deliberately precarious, a design principle mirroring postural instability. The work exemplifies late nineteenth-century scientific realism: beauty subsists in accuracy, and composition is subservient to the demonstration of functional disorder.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The object participates in a visual economy that often transformed patients—frequently poor, elderly women—into teaching specimens. Consent standards were minimal, and medical institutions mediated how such bodies were seen and remembered. Gendered assumptions about frailty and dependence shaped both diagnosis and representation. Today, the piece encourages critical reflection on power: whose suffering becomes public knowledge, who narrates it, and who benefits from the cultural capital of scientific images. The sculpture thus records not only a syndrome but also structural inequities in care, authority, and visibility.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the presence of Lewy bodies composed largely of misfolded alpha‑synuclein. Disrupted basal ganglia circuits lead to bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. Etiology is multifactorial: monogenic forms (e.g., SNCA, LRRK2, Parkin) exist, but most cases are idiopathic, with risk influenced by age, environmental exposures (some pesticides, solvents), and incomplete genetic susceptibility. Non‑motor symptoms—anosmia, constipation, depression, sleep disturbance, and cognitive change—reflect widespread synuclein pathology beyond the nigrostriatal system.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The sculpture crystallizes hallmark signs: a stooped, flexed posture; forward head carriage; reduced arm swing with a semiflexed elbow; and a hand poised as if pill‑rolling. Muscular definition without bulk suggests sarcopenia and rigidity rather than active contraction. The narrow base and downward gaze imply cautious, shuffling gait and fear of retropulsion. Facial attenuation intimates hypomimia. Together, these traits function as an iconography of Parkinsonism legible to both clinicians and art viewers.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In 1895, therapy was symptomatic and limited: rest cures, massage, hydrotherapy, alkaloids (e.g., belladonna derivatives), and mechanical vibration experiments associated with Charcot offered inconsistent relief. The modern standard is dopaminergic replacement—levodopa with carbidopa—supplemented by dopamine agonists, MAO‑B and COMT inhibitors, and amantadine for dyskinesia. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus benefits select patients with medication-refractory motor fluctuations. Exercise, physical therapy, and multidisciplinary care address gait, balance, and non‑motor symptoms.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Ageing populations, occupational toxin exposure, and rural pesticide use intersect with socioeconomic status to shape incidence and outcomes. Access to neurologists, advanced imaging, DBS centers, and consistent medication supply is uneven globally. Caregiver availability, housing stability, nutrition, and health literacy influence adherence, fall risk, and hospitalization. Stigma and gendered caregiving burdens further modulate quality of life and time to diagnosis.</p>
