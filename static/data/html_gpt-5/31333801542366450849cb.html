        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The image belongs to the long European manuscript tradition of the “Zodiac Man” (Homo Signorum). It was typically produced by anonymous monastic or urban workshop scribes who compiled medical–astrological handbooks for physicians, barber-surgeons, and lay readers. Rather than a single named artist, this diagram reflects a collective visual vocabulary forged across Latin Christendom through repeated copying, adaptation, and marginal commentaries.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        The motif flourished from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, when medical learning in universities (Paris, Bologna, Montpellier) synthesized Greco–Roman authorities (Galen, Hippocrates) with Arabic–Islamic scholarship mediated by translations from Iberia and Sicily. Astrology—understood as a mathematical science—was embedded in medical prognostication. Almanacs, computus tables, and perpetual calendars enabled practitioners to time interventions such as bloodletting and purgation with lunar phases and planetary hours. Amid recurrent famine, plague, and warfare, the promise of aligning treatment with celestial rhythms lent intelligibility and control to illness.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        Twelve roundels encircle the nude figure, each the sign of the zodiac, with inked lines mapping their rulership to body zones: Aries governs the head; Taurus the neck; Gemini the shoulders and arms; Cancer the chest; Leo the heart and spine; Virgo the abdomen and viscera; Libra the “reins” (kidneys and lower back); Scorpio the genitals; Sagittarius the thighs; Capricorn the knees; Aquarius the calves; Pisces the feet. The constellation-to-body schema rendered the microcosm–macrocosm analogy visible: the human form as a mirror of the heavens. Text bands and pointing lines act as didactic arrows, turning the folio into a practical instrument.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        The composition is radially organized around the torso, using line as the primary structural device. Modest washes of red, ochre, and gray isolate organs and signs, while the restrained palette maintains legibility on parchment. Proportions are schematic, prioritizing intelligibility over anatomical accuracy. The circular vignettes regularize rhythm and balance; script and image interpenetrate, typical of medieval page design where graphic and textual information co-produce meaning. The figure’s contorted contrapposto is less expressive than functional, opening surfaces for annotation and linkages.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Access to such knowledge hinged on literacy in Latin and on manuscript circulation, which skewed toward clerics, university-trained physicians, and wealthy lay households. Women’s medical expertise—midwifery and household remedies—was frequently excluded from learned compilations, even as female bodies were central to astrological gynecology. Religious minorities and itinerant healers could be marginalized or prosecuted for “superstitious” practice, despite contributing techniques and translations. Rural populations, lacking university practitioners, relied on vernacular epitomes and almanacs, reinforcing urban–rural disparities in care.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        Within this framework, disease arose from dyscrasia—imbalance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile)—whose qualities (hot/cold, wet/dry) were modulated by seasons, diet, age, and astral influences. Planets were thought to imprint temperaments: Saturn (cold, dry) predisposed to melancholy, paralysis, arthritic stiffness; Mars (hot, dry) to hemorrhagic fevers and inflammation; Venus (moist) to reproductive and dermatological conditions; Mercury to nervous or speech disorders; Jupiter to sanguine overabundance. Etiology thus blended environmental exposures with cosmological timing, offering a matrix for prognosis and the “critical days” of an illness.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Practitioners read the body through linked signs: cephalalgia and epistaxis under Aries; sore throats and goiter with Taurus; pleurisy and cough under Cancer; cardialgia and palpitations under Leo; renal colic and “gravel” under Libra; genital ulcers and infertility under Scorpio; gouty pains in the legs under Capricorn–Aquarius; and podalic edema with Pisces. Complementary diagnostics included pulse-taking, inspection of urine flasks (uroscopy color charts), and observation of complexion and stool. The diagram directed where not to cut or bleed when the Moon transited the sign governing that body part, a negative signifier aimed at avoiding iatrogenic harm.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Therapy sought to restore humoral balance through regimen (diet, sleep, exercise), pharmaceutics (herbal simples and compound electuaries), and evacuations (purgatives, emetics, cupping, cautery, phlebotomy). The Zodiac Man guided timing: avoid venesection of the head during Aries; prefer bleeding from the median cubital vein when the Moon was favorable; schedule surgery outside eclipses and in waxing lunar phases for convalescence. Reproductive disorders invited Venusian talismans and uterine fumigations; kidney stones prompted diuretics such as parsley and madder. From a modern biomedical perspective, some elements—hygiene, moderated diet, rest—align with supportive care, while astrological timing lacks evidentiary efficacy and bloodletting, used indiscriminately, could be harmful.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Morbidity patterns reflected nutrition instability, crowding within walled towns, contaminated water, seasonal labor cycles, and exposure to smoke and cold. Class determined access to physicians and to clean foodstuffs recommended by regimina sanitatis. Gender norms affected who received reproductive care or who could act as caregiver. Epidemics (plague, sweating sickness) amplified vulnerability among the poor and mobile workers. The appeal of astrological medicine, visible here, offered both a cosmological explanation for misfortune and a scheduling tool for scarce interventions within these structural constraints.
