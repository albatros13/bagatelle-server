        <h1>Yellow Fever (1793)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The image titled “Yellow Fever (1793)” belongs to the tradition of medical print culture that proliferated in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Specific authorship for such plates is often uncertain; they were frequently produced by anonymous engravers working for publishers of medical treatises and public-health pamphlets. As didactic images, their purpose was less aesthetic autonomy than public instruction—visualizing a sequence of symptoms for physicians and laypeople. The four-part format suggests a workshop versed in serial narrative illustration, akin to the medical “before-and-after” plate and to moralizing sequences popular in contemporary print shops.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        The date anchors the image in the catastrophic yellow fever epidemic that struck Philadelphia in 1793, when the city served as the temporary U.S. capital. Thousands died, commerce halted, and civic institutions were strained. Medical theory was divided between miasmatists, who blamed putrid air, and contagionists, who posited person-to-person spread; the mosquito vector was not recognized until the late nineteenth century. Amid flight of many elites, local clergy, voluntary associations, and free Black mutual aid societies organized care, while printers disseminated reports, advice, and images like this one to translate medical knowledge into popular visual language.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The four panels read like a temporal scroll: from a well-dressed sitter to progressive debility in bed. Color coding is central—healthy ruddiness yields to the pallor and saffron hue of jaundice, then to livid shadows and the “black vomit” associated with hemorrhage. The bedclothes act as both clinical stage and shroud, invoking vanitas themes where mortality is foreshadowed by domestic objects. The unchanging viewpoint isolates the body as a site of observation, mirroring clinical case histories. Blood flecks at the end punctuate the narrative, a stark emblem of crisis and mortality.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        Line and contour dominate, consistent with copperplate or early lithographic methods used in medical atlases. Limited but deliberate hand-coloring heightens diagnostic contrasts—pink flush, yellowed skin, and dark emesis—serving an evidentiary function rather than painterly effect. Repetition with variation structures the series, inviting comparative seeing. The neutral ground and shallow depth suppress anecdote, directing attention to physiognomy and complexion. Such choices align the image with Enlightenment empiricism: the plate becomes an instrument, not just an artwork.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        The epidemic magnified inequality. Poorer residents, recent immigrants, dockworkers, and caregivers lacked the means to flee and bore disproportionate risk. Free Black Philadelphians, mobilized by leaders such as Absalom Jones and Richard Allen, provided nursing and burial services and were later scapegoated in sensational pamphlets. Quarantine policies and economic shutdowns affected artisans and laborers most, while philanthropy and voluntary hospital care exposed racialized hierarchies of trust and blame. Visual documents like this, centered on a single male body, also reflect whose illness was deemed representable and which domestic interiors counted as normative clinical spaces.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease caused by Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), a positive-sense single-stranded RNA flavivirus. Transmission to humans occurs via Aedes mosquitoes—classically Aedes aegypti—in urban cycles; sylvatic (jungle) cycles involve primate reservoirs. After an incubation of roughly 3–6 days, a biphasic illness can occur: an initial febrile phase followed by a toxic phase marked by jaundice, hemorrhage, and multiorgan failure. These mechanisms were unknown in 1793; modern virology and vector biology elucidated them only in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        The plate’s sequence encodes recognizable clinical markers. Early facial flushing corresponds to the viremic febrile phase. The yellowed skin and sclerae signal hepatic injury with hyperbilirubinemia. The gaunt, grey appearance suggests escalating hepatic necrosis, renal dysfunction, and shock. The final panel’s hematemesis—the historical “black vomit”—reflects upper gastrointestinal bleeding from coagulopathy and mucosal injury. Additional classic signs, though not depicted, include relative bradycardia (Faget sign), proteinuria, and delirium. Mortality in the toxic phase can be high, driven by fulminant hepatic failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        In 1793, therapy was empirical and often harmful—purging, calomel, and phlebotomy were common. Contemporary care is supportive: fluid resuscitation, careful hemodynamic management, correction of coagulopathy, renal replacement therapy when indicated, and intensive monitoring for organ failure. No specific antiviral therapy is standard, though investigational agents have been explored. Prevention is paramount: the live-attenuated 17D vaccine provides durable immunity for most recipients, and vector control (eliminating breeding sites, insecticide use, and personal protection) interrupts transmission.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Urban density, maritime trade, climate, and standing water enabled mosquito proliferation in eighteenth-century Philadelphia. Housing quality, sanitation, and labor patterns determined exposure risk. Migration and refugee flows altered population immunity and movement networks. Access to trustworthy information and care shaped outcomes; language barriers and racial prejudice impeded some communities’ ability to act on public-health advice. These determinants remain relevant today in cities facing arboviral threats, where infrastructure, governance, and equity influence epidemic trajectories as much as biology.
