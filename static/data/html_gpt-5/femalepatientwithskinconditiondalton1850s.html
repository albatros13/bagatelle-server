        <h1>Female patient with skin condition (attributed to Dalton), 1850s</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Attributed to “Dalton,” this sheet belongs to the British tradition of mid-nineteenth-century medical illustration in which artists worked alongside hospital clinicians to produce diagnostic plates. Whether “Dalton” denotes a specific illustrator or workshop, the work typifies collaborative practices that linked physicians, lithographers, and colorists. These images straddled portraiture and scientific diagram, intended less as likenesses of individuals than as typified cases for teaching and publication.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in the 1850s, the work sits at a pivotal moment before bacteriology fully reframed disease. Dermatology was crystallizing as a specialty under figures such as Ferdinand von Hebra, who emphasized morphological classification from direct visual study. London’s expanding hospitals and dispensaries furnished clinical material, and chromolithography enabled reproducible color plates for atlases. Public health reforms were nascent, urban crowding severe, and cutaneous disease—often visible and stigmatizing—became a focus of both medical and moral scrutiny.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The artist isolates the head against a blank ground, rendering garments only in contour so that the chromatic attention falls on the lesions. The three-quarter gaze humanizes the subject yet submits her to the “medical gaze,” converting an individual into a specimen of disease. Red-brown plaques and papules are heightened beyond naturalism to serve as semiotic anchors: color, relief, and distribution signal diagnostic meaning. The face—seat of identity—becomes a map of pathology, a visual rhetoric common to dermatological atlases of the era.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Formally, the sheet blends tonal modeling of facial planes with line drawing elsewhere, creating a hierarchy of information. Limited palette, crisp contour, and controlled hatching foreground texture—crust, edema, and scarring—over broader chiaroscuro. Balance and emphasis direct the eye to the forehead where confluent plaques dominate, while scattered lesions on cheeks establish rhythm and repetition. The naturalistic head contrasted with schematic clothing epitomizes the hybrid portrait-diagram idiom prized for clinical clarity.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Nineteenth-century hospital art disproportionately pictured poor and working-class patients whose access to charity wards enabled their depiction. Facial disfigurement carried marked social penalties for women, intersecting with gendered expectations of respectability and marriageability. Diagnostic uncertainty between infectious conditions (tuberculosis) and moralized diagnoses (syphilis) amplified stigma. Limited access to effective therapy and reconstructive care meant that poverty, not merely biology, governed outcomes.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Based on distribution, color, and morphology, the image is consistent with lupus vulgaris (cutaneous tuberculosis), though differential diagnoses in the period included smallpox scarring, chronic impetigo, severe acne, and tertiary syphilis. Lupus vulgaris is a form of tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infecting the skin via hematogenous spread, contiguous extension, or exogenous inoculation. In the 1850s its cause was unknown; only after Koch’s 1882 discovery was its tuberculous nature affirmed. Typically indolent, it favors the head and neck, forms reddish-brown plaques and nodules, and leads to atrophy and scarring if untreated.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The forehead shows coalescent, erythematous plaques with surface crust and irregular borders; discrete papules and nodules scatter across the cheeks. Such lesions correspond to dermal granulomatous inflammation with caseation, producing the classic “apple-jelly” translucency on diascopy described in nineteenth-century texts. Relative symmetry and chronicity differentiate lupus vulgaris from acute, monomorphic vesiculo-pustules of smallpox; the lack of gummatous ulceration argues against late syphilis. The illustrator’s heightened reds and careful stippling function as coded signs for clinicians trained to read morphology.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Historically, therapies included topical caustics (potassa fusa), iodine and arsenicals, curettage, and galvanocautery; by the 1890s, Finsen’s phototherapy achieved notable remissions in lupus vulgaris. In the modern era, treatment aligns with systemic anti-tuberculous multidrug regimens tailored to drug susceptibility, with surgical debulking or laser therapy for residual fibrosis and scarring. Reconstruction and psychosocial support address functional and social sequelae. The image reminds us that before effective antimicrobials, management prioritized palliation and containment rather than cure.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Tuberculosis thrives where overcrowding, poor ventilation, malnutrition, and precarious labor prevail—conditions endemic to industrial cities of the 1850s. Gendered caregiving roles increased exposure risks, and limited autonomy curtailed care-seeking. Stigma surrounding visible facial disease impeded employment and marriage, reinforcing poverty loops that further worsened health. Contemporary TB control underscores the same determinants—housing, income, and access to care—highlighting the continuity between the scene depicted and present-day inequities.</p>
