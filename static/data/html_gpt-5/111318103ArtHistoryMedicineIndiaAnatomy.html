<p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</p>
<p>This didactic anatomical image belongs to the Tibeto-Indian medical tradition that drew on classical Ayurveda while developing the distinctive medical system known as Sowa Rigpa. Such images were typically produced by workshop painters working with physician-scholars; authorship is collective rather than individual. The genre crystallized around medical thangka sets associated with the Four Tantras (Gyushi) and later commentaries such as the Blue Beryl, which standardized iconography for classroom use in Himalayan medical colleges. The figure is not a portrait but a schematic body used to visualize channels, organs, and therapeutic points for diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</p>
<p>The visual program likely descends from models codified between the 17th and 19th centuries, when monastic and court-sponsored medical schools flourished in Tibet, Ladakh, Bhutan, and adjoining Himalayan regions with strong links to North India. Physicians trained through memorization of root texts, commentary, and examination of wall charts and scroll paintings. The imagery integrates Indian Ayurvedic physiology—especially tridoṣa theory—with Central Asian and indigenous Himalayan conceptions of winds, channels, and essences. These medical paintings circulated across trade routes connecting Kashmir and Bengal to the plateau, circulating pigments, paper, and ideas alongside materia medica such as myrobalans, asafoetida, and musk.</p>

<p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</p>
<p>The frontal standing body, raised hands, and inscribed labels map a network of rtsa (channels) and nodal points where wind, bile, and phlegm act. Colored discs and dots denote loci for pulse interpretation, cautery, venesection, and massage. The triangular element within the torso functions as an alchemical furnace, symbolizing digestive fire (agni) that transforms food into nutritive essences; adjacent lunar and solar motifs indicate cooling and heating balances governing metabolism. The ordered arrays of pellets in the abdomen represent humoral reservoirs and waste pathways. Rather than anatomical verism, the diagram communicates functional relationships—how breath, heat, and moisture circulate—binding cosmology to the clinic by aligning microcosmic physiology with the macrocosm’s elements and seasons.</p>

<p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</p>
<p>The painting exploits contour line, flat color fields, and schematic proportion to maximize legibility. Mineral pigments and opaque washes produce durable planes against a cool green ground that isolates the figure as a teaching device. Repetition of circles creates rhythmic emphasis at diagnostic points, while hierarchical scaling gives organs and channel junctions prominence over naturalistic musculature. Text is integral to composition: labels bracket forms, converting the picture into a hybrid of image and index. This synthesis of diagram and thangka aesthetics exemplifies information design before modern infographics.</p>

<p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</p>
<p>Access to learned medical care in the Himalayan-Indian world historically depended on monastery proximity, patronage, and language. Elite households could commission consultations and herb preparations, while pastoralists and agriculturalists relied more on itinerant healers and household remedies. Women’s health often remained under-documented despite midwifery traditions. In the colonial and postcolonial periods, biomedical institutions sometimes marginalized indigenous practitioners, affecting training pipelines and licensure, though recent legal recognition of Sowa Rigpa in India has begun to address these inequities.</p>

<p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</p>
<p>Using the image’s digestive focus, a representative illness is ulcer-like dyspepsia. In Sowa Rigpa/Ayurvedic terms it corresponds to a bile-dominant disorder: excess heat from pungent foods, alcohol, anger, or summer climate inflames the stomach furnace, drying protective phlegm and disturbing winds, leading to burning epigastric pain and sour regurgitation. In biomedical terms, peptic ulcer disease arises chiefly from Helicobacter pylori infection or from NSAID-related mucosal injury; gastric acid and pepsin perpetuate lesions. Risk is increased by smoking, alcohol, stress, and certain comorbidities.</p>

<p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</p>
<p>Traditional examination emphasizes palpation at labeled abdominal points, pulse reading at specific channel sites, and urine inspection for color, steam, and sediment—indices of heat, wind agitation, and nutritive assimilation. Biomedical signs include epigastric pain that improves or worsens with meals, nocturnal pain, bloating, nausea, iron-deficiency anemia, melena, or hematemesis. Red-flag signs (weight loss, vomiting, bleeding) prompt endoscopy and biopsy to exclude malignancy and confirm H. pylori.</p>

<p>[h] Treatment</p>
<p>Traditional therapy cools bile and protects mucosa: dietary moderation emphasizing barley, cooling fruits (amla), and ghee; avoidance of chili, spirits, and sun exposure. Polyherbal compounds may include amalaki, licorice, and kutki to harmonize heat and support liver-stomach function; external measures include gentle oil massage to calm wind and, where appropriate, cautery or moxibustion at selected points—though heating methods are tempered in bile-excess states. Biomedical management treats H. pylori with 14-day triple or quadruple regimens (a proton-pump inhibitor with clarithromycin and amoxicillin or metronidazole, or bismuth-quadruple therapy), followed by eradication testing. For NSAID ulcers, discontinue the offending drug, provide PPI therapy, and evaluate for complications. Lifestyle measures—tobacco cessation, reduced alcohol, and stress management—complement pharmacotherapy.</p>

<p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</p>
<p>Ulcer risk correlates with crowding and sanitation (facilitating H. pylori transmission), food insecurity that pushes toward irritant diets, limited access to diagnostic endoscopy, and labor patterns that encourage chronic NSAID use. High-altitude livelihoods can constrain fresh produce and refrigeration, shaping microbiomes and salt intake. Language and cost barriers affect whether patients reach biomedical or traditional clinics, while legal recognition and insurance coverage influence continuity of care across systems.</p>
