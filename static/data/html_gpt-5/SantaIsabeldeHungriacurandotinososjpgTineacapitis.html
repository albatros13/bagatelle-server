        <h1>Santa Isabel de Hungría curando tiñosos (Tinea capitis)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The painting is widely attributed to the Spanish Baroque master Bartolomé Esteban Murillo (1617–1682), renowned in Seville for devotional works joining compassion with acute observation of everyday life. The subject is Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, medieval royal and model of Christian charity, shown ministering to the sick poor. Murillo’s association with charitable confraternities in Seville, particularly the Hermandad de la Caridad, situates this work within a program that joined art, philanthropy, and public health.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in the later 17th century, the painting reflects a Seville recovering from plague, famine, and economic contraction. Counter-Reformation ideals promoted visible acts of mercy, and confraternal hospitals functioned as nodes of social care for the destitute. Artists like Murillo provided altarpieces that moralized charity while documenting urban realities: overcrowding, disease transmission, and fragile welfare structures. The scene merges hagiographic narrative with contemporary hospital practice, capturing the intersection of religion, medicine, and civic responsibility.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>Saint Elizabeth’s crown and luminous head covering identify royal sanctity redirected to service of the poor. The basin of water and attendants with vessels evoke cleansing and nursing, while the sick line up for attention, some exposing scalps suggestive of fungal infection historically labeled “tiña.” Architectural vistas imply an institutional setting, locating care within civic space. Gestures of touch and washing encode caritas as both spiritual and hygienic, and the contrast between sumptuous drapery and tattered garments underscores the Christian inversion of status.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Murillo tempers dramatic chiaroscuro with a warm, humane light that models flesh and fabric softly. A diagonal rhythm guides the eye from the kneeling sufferer through the basin to the saint’s face, producing narrative clarity. The palette ranges from earthen browns to gentle rose and ivory, supporting a mood of compassion rather than theatricality. Naturalistic textures—scalp stubble, rough cloth, and weathered skin—serve documentary ends, while the balanced grouping and controlled perspective convey order amidst human distress.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting visualizes health inequity: impoverished bodies seek relief from preventable, treatable conditions. Charity mitigates suffering but also signals structural deficits—crowded housing, poor sanitation, and limited access to trained practitioners. The central female saint models caregiving often assigned to women within early modern charity, while the anonymous sick attest to how class and marginalization shape exposure to disease and barriers to cure.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection of the scalp and hair shafts caused primarily by Trichophyton and Microsporum species. Transmission occurs via direct contact, shared combs or headwear, contaminated bedding, and, for zoophilic species, contact with animals. In early modern Iberia, crowding in orphanages, workhouses, and schools promoted spread. The term “tiñosos” historically encompassed scalp ringworm sufferers, whose condition was contagious yet stigmatized.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinically, tinea capitis presents with scaly alopecic patches (“gray patch”), broken hairs (“black dot”), pruritus, and sometimes a suppurative inflammatory mass (kerion) with cervical lymphadenopathy. The shaved or closely cropped heads in the scene, along with attention to scaly, denuded scalp areas, correspond to historical depictions of ringworm management. While artistic representation cannot diagnose, the iconography aligns with the period’s description of tiña as a visible, transmissible scalp disease.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Seventeenth-century care emphasized shaving, washing, and topical salves (sulfur, mercury, herbal preparations). These measures reduced fungal load but were inconsistently effective and sometimes toxic. Modern evidence-based therapy requires systemic antifungals—griseofulvin or terbinafine as first-line agents in many regions—with adjunctive antifungal shampoos (selenium sulfide or ketoconazole) to limit transmission. Culture or PCR can guide species-specific choice, and management includes decontaminating fomites, screening household contacts, and treating pets when zoophilic species are implicated.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Risk is shaped by crowding, poverty, limited water access, school and institutional living, animal exposure, and health literacy. Stigma surrounding visible scalp disease can delay care, particularly for children. Today, disparities persist where antifungals are costly or unavailable, or where primary care access is limited. Public health responses—school screening, community hygiene campaigns, and affordable medicines—address the same determinants that the painting makes visible in its queue of the needy.</p>
