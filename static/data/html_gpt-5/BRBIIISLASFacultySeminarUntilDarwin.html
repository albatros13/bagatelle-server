        <h1>Faculty Seminar Until Darwin</h1>
        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
        The composition belongs to the tradition of nineteenth-century scientific illustration, produced by anonymous lithographers and draftspeople who worked in close collaboration with physicians and antiquarians. Authorship in this genre was often collective and workshop-based, privileging technical exactitude over individual signature. The image juxtaposes a typographic title page with paired lateral skull profiles, a visual language intended to confer empirical authority and facilitate comparison. As an object, it sits between art and data: an artifact of print culture whose aesthetic decisions shape how evidence is seen.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
        The work crystallizes a moment in the 1830s–1840s, before evolutionary theory gained broad scientific consolidation. Debates over monogenism and polygenism—whether all humans shared a single origin—framed the collection and measurement of skulls as a pathway to knowledge about history, civilization, and putative “types.” Lithographic presses in Atlantic cities enabled wide circulation of visual plates used in lectures, museums, and learned societies. The era’s confidence in measurement coincided with colonial extraction of human remains and the growth of medical museums, embedding scientific practice within imperial and settler-colonial networks.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
        Skulls function as memento mori in European art, yet here they become typological specimens. The strict profile view, lack of individualized identity, and neutral background symbolize an aspiration to objectivity. The title page, with its serif typography and references to “anatomy, history, and monuments,” operates iconographically as a seal of authority, promising a synthesis of textual erudition and bodily evidence. References to Egypt in such works evoked antiquity as a proving ground for arguments about human difference, aligning archaeological prestige with anatomical claims.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
        The plates employ lithographic shading, stippling, and crisp contour to render sutures, foramina, and cranial vault curvature. Seriality—two comparable profiles—invites the eye to measure, while the uncluttered field and lateral orientation stabilize the viewer’s gaze. Balance and repetition create a rhetoric of neutrality; scale is implied rather than calibrated, encouraging qualitative judgment masquerading as quantitative rigor. These choices exemplify how scientific illustration constructs “facts” through conventions of clarity, contrast, and normalization.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
        The craniological project was entangled with scientific racism. Human remains were frequently seized from graves or purchased through coercive networks, often targeting Indigenous, African-descended, and colonized communities. Measurements were mobilized to justify slavery, segregation, and hierarchies of civilization. The absence of consent and the exclusion of non-European scholars from authorship produced epistemic injustice that continues to reverberate in museum collections and pedagogy. Contemporary ethical frameworks and repatriation laws seek to redress these harms.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
        Skulls can register several conditions. Craniosynostosis—premature fusion of cranial sutures—arises from genetic variants or sporadic developmental errors, producing scaphocephaly, brachycephaly, or trigonocephaly depending on the suture involved. Nutritional iron-deficiency anemia, parasitic infection, or chronic inflammation can lead to porous remodeling of cranial bones. Vitamin D deficiency (rickets) in growing children causes defective mineralization, craniotabes, and frontal bossing. Treponemal disease (yaws, bejel, or syphilis) may yield characteristic caries sicca lesions on the vault. In the nineteenth century, such features were often misread as racial markers rather than expressions of health, diet, or environment.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
        Diagnostic skeletal signs include: ridged or obliterated sutures with elongated crania in craniosynostosis; porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia in anemia; porous, undermineralized bone and softened occiput in rickets; stellate, pitted lesions with healed margins in treponemal disease. The depicted profiles emphasize patent sutures and smooth vaults typical of adult crania; they are not, by themselves, diagnostic. Their didactic pairing nonetheless trained viewers to equate variation in vault angle or facial projection with essential difference, a category error that transformed normal diversity and disease sequelae into typologies.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment<br>
        Contemporary care contrasts sharply with historical assumptions. Craniosynostosis is treated with endoscopic or open cranial vault remodeling in infancy, supported by helmet therapy when indicated. Iron-deficiency anemia responds to iron supplementation, deworming, malaria control, and addressing menstrual or obstetric blood loss. Treponemal infection is effectively treated with penicillin. Rickets prevention and therapy employ vitamin D and calcium, with attention to sunlight access and diet. Equally important are ethical treatments of human remains: consultation, provenance research, and repatriation, alongside transparent collection policies and descendant-community leadership.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
        Nutrition, pathogen exposure, housing, labor regimes, and access to care shape skeletal health. Enslavement, forced migration, and poverty elevated burdens of anemia and infection; urban crowding and limited sunlight contributed to rickets. Structural racism influenced who became specimens, whose stories were told, and which bodies bore the costs of knowledge. Recognizing these determinants reframes skulls from racial emblems to archives of lived environments and inequality.</p>
