        <p><strong>Caption:</strong> anemia</p>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Unknown European painter working within the Baroque Catholic tradition. The composition and subject matter suggest a workshop attuned to Counter-Reformation devotional imagery, where miracles, intercession, and embodied suffering were prominent themes.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The likely time-frame is the late 17th to 18th century, when religious painting across Italy, Spain, and their spheres emphasized affective piety. In this era, repeated cycles of famine, epidemic disease, and maritime risk shaped devotional practices. Art functioned catechetically, aligning with ecclesiastical calls for emotionally persuasive images that testified to grace in the midst of bodily frailty.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The celestial beings descending through vaporous clouds and the gestures of intercession frame a drama of rescue at sea. Figures at the water’s edge and on a vessel evoke common iconographies of salvation and healing, where pale, languid bodies signify peril and dependence on sacred aid. Such scenes often encoded illnesses not by explicit wounds but through physiognomy—pallor, limpness, and gestures of fainting—allowing viewers to recognize a spectrum of afflictions, including blood disorders such as anemia, through culturally legible signs of weakness and breathlessness.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Dynamic diagonals sweep from the ship to the angels, generating tension between the earthly and the divine. Chiaroscuro models flesh with cool highlights against storm-dark grounds, making pallid skin a focal sign. Billowing drapery and foreshortened bodies create immediacy and theatricality, while selective illumination isolates vulnerable figures, a Baroque device that doubles as a semiotic cue for illness.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Anemia historically clustered where poverty constrained diets and labor demands were high. Women of reproductive age, pregnant people, children, and manual laborers were disproportionately affected. In maritime and colonial economies, enslaved and indentured workers, as well as sailors sustained on iron-poor rations, faced chronic undernutrition and parasitic infections—inequities that art sometimes registers as generalized fragility rather than individualized portraiture.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Anemia is a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration, impairing oxygen delivery. Etiologies include iron deficiency (dietary insufficiency, blood loss from menstruation or gastrointestinal bleeding, hookworm), anemia of chronic inflammation, hemolytic disorders, inherited hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell disease, thalassemias), and megaloblastic anemia from vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. In early modern Europe, recurrent pregnancies, hemorrhage, poor diets, and endemic parasites created a high background prevalence.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinically, anemia manifests as pallor of skin and mucosae, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, orthostatic dizziness, and sometimes edema. Iron deficiency may produce glossitis, angular cheilitis, and koilonychia; B12 deficiency can cause neuropathy; hemolysis may yield jaundice. Artists translated these into visual cues: ashen complexions contrasting with healthy rosy tones, fainting postures, limp limbs, and assisted breathing suggested by open mouths or uplifted chests—all legible to period viewers as signs of life “ebbing.”</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Early modern therapy mixed humoral approaches with empirical advances: tonics and “chalybeate” (iron-rich) waters were prescribed for chlorosis and weakness. Bloodletting persisted yet likely worsened anemia in many. Contemporary management targets cause: oral or intravenous iron for iron deficiency; folate or vitamin B12 replacement for megaloblastosis; deworming and malaria control where endemic; transfusion for severe cases; erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in specific renal or oncologic contexts; and anti-inflammatory treatment for anemia of chronic disease.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Dietary access, sanitation, parasite exposure, menstruation and pregnancy without supportive care, occupational strain, and poverty remain decisive. Education, gender equity, and fortification programs reduce risk; conversely, food insecurity, conflict, and migration increase burden. The painting’s maritime setting hints at broader structures—trade routes, provisioning systems, and religious charity—through which bodies were sustained or neglected.</p>
