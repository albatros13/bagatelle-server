<h1>Japanese Manuscript: The opening set of flaps detailing the anterior and posterior views of a male figure (1)</h1>

<h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
<p>
The manuscript most likely comes from an anonymous Edo-period medical atelier associated with Kampo (traditional Japanese medicine) and, later, rangaku (Dutch-learning) circles. Such albums were frequently compiled by physician-scribes who blended hand-copied textual excerpts with didactic figures. The absence of a signature is typical of practical medical books intended for instruction rather than individual artistic fame.
</p>

<h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
<p>
This type of interactive anatomical image—often with hinged flaps revealing deeper layers—flourished in the mid- to late Edo period (seventeenth to nineteenth centuries). Japan’s medical culture then was plural: long-standing Sino-Japanese therapeutics (as preserved from classics like the Ishinhō) coexisted with new anatomical knowledge transmitted via Dutch texts, culminating famously in the Kaitai Shinsho (1774). Urbanization, print culture, and domainal medical schools fostered the circulation of illustrated manuals that combined empiricism (dissection reports, nosology) with humoral/qi-based explanatory schemes.
</p>

<h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
<p>
The pairing of anterior and posterior views is a long-standing convention for mapping bodily surfaces. The raised leg and turning gesture open the groin and gluteal areas, signaling a pedagogical focus on reproductive and excretory anatomy as well as muscular landmarks used in palpation and needling. The calligraphic labels index a didactic intent. The modesty covering with a botanical cluster, whether original or added in a later copying, acts symbolically to mark generative capacity while satisfying decorum; plants in medical imagery often act as euphemisms for sexuality and fertility.
</p>

<h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
<p>
The figures are outlined with a steady ink contour and filled with flat, warm washes on washi, prioritizing legibility over illusionism. Spatial depth is minimal, producing a diagrammatic clarity. Symmetry between the two stances aids comparison, while the interactive flap format introduces sequential viewing—an early “layered” visualization analogous to cutaway plates in European anatomical atlases. The balance of line, wash, and text exemplifies Edo didactic design: economical, mnemonic, and tactile.
</p>

<h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
<p>
Access to authoritative medical knowledge in the Edo period was stratified. Domain schools privileged samurai lineages, and literacy barriers limited popular use. Anatomical dissection—critical for accurate depictions—often relied on the bodies of socially marginalized people and was episodically restricted by custom. Sex workers, crucial to urban economies, bore disproportionate burdens of venereal disease yet had limited access to treatment, an inequity reflected in medical writings that pathologized their bodies while using them as clinical exemplars.
</p>

<h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
<p>
While the sheet is not a diagnostic portrait, its didactic exposure of genital and perineal regions aligns with concerns about sexually transmitted infections, especially syphilis (baidoku), prevalent in early modern Japanese cities. Modern biomedicine identifies the causative agent as Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, transmitted primarily through sexual contact and vertically in pregnancy. After inoculation, spirochetes disseminate via lymphatics and blood, evading immunity through antigenic variation. Pre-modern Japanese etiologies framed such illness as disordered qi, impurity, or imbalance aggravated by sexual excess; Edo physicians debated the roles of contagion, heredity, and moral conduct.
</p>

<h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
<p>
Syphilis typically progresses through stages: a primary chancre at the inoculation site; secondary rash (often palms and soles), mucous patches, and generalized lymphadenopathy; latent phases; and, without therapy, tertiary gummatous, cardiovascular, or neurosyphilitic disease. Clinical manuals of the era recorded genital ulcers, condylomata, bone pain, and facial lesions. A chart like this would have served to localize lesions for inspection, to instruct palpation of nodes, and to indicate areas avoided or targeted in moxibustion and needling rather than to render specific symptoms.
</p>

<h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
<p>
Therapeutics shifted across the period. Kampo treatments emphasized purgatives, blood “cooling,” and detoxifying formulas, along with moxibustion and acupuncture for pain and constitutional weakness. Under rangaku influence, mercury-based ointments and later sarsaparilla entered practice, with mixed efficacy and notable toxicity. In the Meiji and Taishō eras, Salvarsan (arsphenamine, 1910) provided targeted chemotherapy, ultimately superseded by penicillin in the mid-twentieth century—the present standard of care.
</p>

<h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
<p>
Urban crowding, migration, and the organization of licensed quarters (such as Yoshiwara) increased sexual-network connectivity, accelerating STI spread. Economic precarity, debt bondage among courtesans, and gendered power relations constrained negotiation of safer practices. Stigma limited disclosure and follow-up. Education and access to physicians varied by status and locale; Western-style dispensaries in treaty ports later narrowed but did not eliminate disparities. These determinants shaped both the epidemiology of syphilis and the demand for practical anatomical pedagogies like this manuscript.
