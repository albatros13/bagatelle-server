        <h1>Perisananatomy</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>An anonymous Persian illustrator working in a medical manuscript atelier. The figure follows models associated with Mansur ibn Ilyas of Shiraz (late 14th–early 15th c.), whose Tashrih‑i Mansuri standardized full-body anatomical diagrams. Authorship is uncertain, but the calligraphic labels and didactic line place the sheet squarely within the Persian–Islamic scientific book tradition.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Time-frame: late medieval to early modern Persianate world (c. 1390–1550). Islamic medicine synthesized Galenic and Alexandrian legacies—transmitted via Syriac and Arabic translation—with clinical observation in bimaristans. Courtly patronage under Timurid and Safavid rulers supported illustrated compendia for teaching. Paper technologies and mobile scholars linked Shiraz, Herat, and Isfahan, creating a cosmopolitan medical language in which humoral theory, astrology, and pharmacology coexisted.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>Iconographically the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestines dominate, ringed by vermillion vessels. This hierarchy reflects Galenic physiology: heart as vital spirit, liver as blood’s source, gut as the furnace of digestion. The splayed, frontal pose evokes the flayed-man yet remains modest. Labels double as ornament, integrating knowledge into the page’s arabesque. A circular contour at the head hints at macrocosm–microcosm correspondences guiding prognosis and regimen.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Formally, linear clarity outranks naturalism. Transparent stacking of organs, even tempo of red lines, and flat fields favor legibility over depth. Scale produces hierarchy: central organs enlarge; peripheries repeat in rhythmic parallels. The sheet belongs to an atlas genre for instruction rather than autopsy-based realism, its brisk brushwork signaling workshop efficiency and reproducibility.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Manuscript culture encoded inequity. Illustrated codices were costly; literacy in Persian and Arabic medical idioms limited readership to urban elites and madrasa-trained physicians. Women’s access to formal instruction lagged despite roles as midwives and healers. Rural and enslaved populations relied on oral knowledge with fewer visual aids. Patronage determined what bodies were pictured and which treatments were financed.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>With the gut foregrounded, dysentery offers a productive biomedical lens. Pre‑modern authors (al‑Razi, Ibn Sina) framed etiology as corrupt bile or intestinal putrefaction from heat, spoiled water, or diet. Modern science identifies invasive pathogens—chiefly Shigella spp. and Entamoeba histolytica—transmitted fecal–orally. These breach colonic mucosa, trigger neutrophilic inflammation, and ulcerate tissue; amebae may seed the liver. The image’s attention to colon and mesenteric channels echoes clinical focus on tenesmus, lower‑abdominal pain, and stool character.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Pathology presents with fever, cramping, and bloody or mucoid stools; dehydration threatens infants and elders. In amebiasis, flask‑shaped colonic ulcers and hepatic abscesses may occur. Though microbes are unseen, the drawing’s networks signify routes—vessels and conduits—through which imbalance or contagion travels. Annotations beside the bowel guided differential diagnosis by frequency, color, and odor of stool, paralleling modern severity scores and laboratory tests.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Historical therapy combined regimen (cooling diets, rice water), astringents (quince, pomegranate rind), opiates for pain, and, in sanguine excess, phlebotomy or cupping. Evidence‑based care today centers on prompt oral rehydration with low‑osmolar ORS, zinc for children, and targeted antibiotics for bacillary dysentery per resistance patterns (often azithromycin); antimotility drugs are avoided in febrile bloody diarrhea. Amebiasis requires metronidazole plus a luminal agent. Public‑health measures—safe water, sanitation, hand hygiene, and emerging Shigella vaccines—remain decisive.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Exposure and outcome are shaped by social determinants. Sanitation, potable water, and waste management track closely with enteric disease burdens. Poverty limits time and fuel for boiling water; displacement packs families into camps with fragile hygiene. Education mediates care‑seeking and ORS use; gender norms can delay treatment for women and girls. In the manuscript economy, access to accurate diagrams paralleled access to trained clinicians—knowledge itself a determinant of survival, echoed today in gaps in diagnostics and antibiotics.</p>
