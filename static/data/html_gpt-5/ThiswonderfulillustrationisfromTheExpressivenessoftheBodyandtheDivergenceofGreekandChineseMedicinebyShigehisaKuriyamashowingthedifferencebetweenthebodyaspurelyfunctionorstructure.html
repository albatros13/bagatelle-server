        <h1>The Expressiveness of the Body and the Divergence of Greek and Chinese Medicine</h1>
        <p>Caption: The Expressiveness of the Body and the Divergence of Greek and Chinese Medicine by Shigehisa Kuriyama showing the difference between the body as purely function or structure.</p>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This comparative image juxtaposes two traditions: a Chinese acupuncture chart by an anonymous woodblock artist working within the classical lineage of the Huangdi Neijing, and a European anatomical plate after Andreas Vesalius from De Humani Corporis Fabrica (1543). The pairing was reproduced and analyzed by historian Shigehisa Kuriyama to illuminate divergent ways of seeing the body—one oriented to functional pathways of vital movement, the other to structural anatomy revealed by dissection.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The Vesalian figure emerges from sixteenth‑century Renaissance humanism in Padua, where sanctioned dissection, classical revival, and print culture fostered a new, empirically grounded anatomy. The Chinese figure reflects a long evolution from the Han through the Ming, when physicians synthesized cosmology, correlative thinking, and therapeutic practice into visual guides for needling and moxibustion. In late imperial China, ethical reservations about cutting the body limited dissection, whereas in Europe changing civic, religious, and university norms made the cadaver a privileged source of knowledge.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The Chinese body is inscribed with channels and points, named with evocative titles that align the person with seasons, winds, and landscape metaphors. The figure’s slightly animated posture underscores circulation and transformation. The Vesalian écorché, flayed to reveal musculature, stands in contrapposto amid ruins that signal antiquity and the rebirth of classical science. The iconography of exposure—skin peeled back—signifies truth through unveiling material structure.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Line in the Chinese print is calligraphic and diagrammatic, favoring clarity of pathways over volumetric modeling; space is shallow, labels dense, and rhythm established by repeating points. The Vesalian plate pursues chiaroscuro and plasticity; anatomical masses are modeled with precise hatchings that create depth, weight, and torsion. Both rely on idealization: the Chinese figure abstracts individuality to emphasize generalizable flows; the European plate generalizes musculature to an exemplary male athletic type.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Knowledge-making in both traditions was shaped by access and hierarchy. In Europe, only universities and guilds could legally procure bodies—excluding women and most artisans from authorship. In China, literacy and examination culture privileged elite physicians; corporeal knowledge from midwives and manual healers was often marginalized. Later, colonial and global circuits unevenly validated Western anatomy while appropriating acupuncture, sometimes stripping it of its cosmological meanings.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>As a case threaded through both images, consider sciatica. In the Chinese framework it is often categorized as bi syndrome—painful obstruction—arising when wind, cold, and damp invade and lodge in the channels of the leg (notably the Foot Taiyang Bladder and Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder), compounded by qi and blood stasis. In the European anatomical-structural model, sciatica typically results from compression or irritation of the L4–S3 nerve roots, commonly due to lumbar disc herniation or foraminal stenosis, with inflammation mediating nociception.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Chinese diagnostics read patterns: radiating posterior‑lateral leg pain following channel trajectories, aversion to cold, and palpatory “ashì” points at GB30 or BL40. Tongue and pulse may show stagnation or dampness. Western examination seeks dermatomal distribution, weakness in ankle dorsiflexion or plantarflexion, diminished reflexes, and a positive straight‑leg raise, all correlated to radicular involvement mapped onto the Vesalian neuromuscular architecture.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Chinese therapeutics mobilize flow and dispel obstruction: acupuncture at BL23, BL40, BL60, GB30, GB34 with reinforcing or reducing techniques; moxibustion to warm cold-damp; and classical formulas such as Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang adjusted to constitution. Manual therapy and qigong extend regulation beyond the clinic. Biomedicine emphasizes graded activity, NSAIDs, and physical therapy targeting core and hip abductors, with options including epidural steroid injection or microdiscectomy for persistent neurologic deficit. Evidence suggests acupuncture can reduce pain and improve function for sciatica in select patients, though mechanisms may include neuromodulation rather than meridian flow in biomedical terms.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Occupational strain, cold or damp living conditions, limited access to safe work and ergonomic protections, and economic precarity elevate risk and delay recovery. Cultural framing matters: patients socialized in either tradition interpret symptoms and adhere to care differently. Insurance coverage and regulation may privilege surgery or pharmaceuticals over time-intensive acupuncture or rehabilitation, reproducing inequities in outcomes.</p>
