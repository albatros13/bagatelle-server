        <h1>Cholera</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This image is a nineteenth-century commercial print, likely a lithograph produced for broad public circulation. Such works were often issued by anonymous or little-documented printers who catered to popular interest in medical phenomena. The emphasis lies less on an identifiable author and more on the print as a mass-cultural artifact: an image conceived for didactic and sensational purposes during a time when epidemic disease was a defining social anxiety.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The print belongs to the era of the second cholera pandemic (c. 1829–1851), when “Asiatic” or “Indian” cholera moved along trade and military routes from South Asia to Europe and the Americas. Britain experienced devastating outbreaks beginning in 1831–1832, with industrial port towns often among the first sites affected. The caption’s reference to “Indian cholera” and an English locale reflects the global and colonial circuits through which both people and pathogens traveled, as well as the period’s contested theories of disease transmission: miasma (bad air) versus emerging contagionist and waterborne ideas later powerfully articulated by John Snow during the 1854 London epidemic.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The supine figure on a simple mattress, limbs extended and lips parted, visualizes the exhausted, desiccated body characteristic of fatal cholera. The immobility and pallor evoke the period’s epithet “the blue death,” referencing peripheral cyanosis caused by severe circulatory collapse. The rolled bolster and bare mattress are iconographic shorthand for improvised sickrooms, underscoring domestic vulnerability and the speed with which cholera overwhelmed households. The printed caption—naming cholera’s geographic origin—reifies a colonial imaginary that framed the disease as an external, exotic threat even as it exploited local infrastructural weaknesses in sanitation and water supply.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Lithographic line and tonal wash create a restrained grisaille, heightening clinical clarity over sentiment. Contour lines describe the emaciated limbs; light falls across the torso, directing the eye to the body’s diagnostic surfaces. The composition is rectilinear and frontal, akin to an anatomical plate, with minimal background to remove narrative distraction. The balance between descriptive detail (hands, facial features) and simplified setting positions the print at the intersection of popular illustration and medical didacticism, anticipating later public-health imagery that combines legibility, affective impact, and instructive purpose.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Cholera mortality mapped onto nineteenth-century inequities: overcrowded housing, shared pumps, cesspits, and inadequate drainage in working-class districts. Migrants and the poor were stigmatized, while authorities sometimes imposed coercive measures that deepened mistrust. The term “Indian cholera” displaced responsibility onto colonized geographies even as imperial trade networks enabled the pathogen’s spread. Access to clean water, medical care, and trustworthy information became social privileges rather than universal rights, a pattern that echoes in modern outbreaks.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae, primarily serogroups O1 and O139. After ingestion via contaminated water or food, the organism colonizes the small intestine, aided by the toxin-coregulated pilus, and secretes cholera toxin (CtxAB). The A subunit activates adenylate cyclase through Gsα, raising intracellular cAMP and driving CFTR-mediated chloride secretion; water follows osmotically, producing profuse “rice-water” stools. Without rapid fluid replacement, hypovolemia, metabolic acidosis, and shock ensue.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinically, severe cases present with sudden, watery diarrhea, vomiting, intense muscle cramps, tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria, and signs of dehydration: sunken eyes, dry mucosa, poor skin turgor, cool extremities, and in extreme states, cyanosis. The image’s gaunt limbs and fixed gaze correspond to catastrophic fluid loss and collapse. Postmortem rigidity depicted here participates in a visual repertoire that nineteenth-century viewers would have associated with epidemic death and the moral urgency of sanitary reform.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Definitive therapy centers on rapid rehydration. Oral rehydration solution (ORS)—a precise glucose-electrolyte formulation—exploits sodium-glucose cotransport to restore volume. In severe dehydration, intravenous fluids (e.g., Ringer’s lactate) are life-saving. Antibiotics (such as doxycycline, azithromycin, or ciprofloxacin, depending on local resistance) reduce stool volume and duration but do not replace fluids. Zinc supplementation benefits children. Preventive measures include safe water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH), and currently available oral cholera vaccines used for outbreak response and in endemic settings.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Risk is structured by infrastructure: piped, chlorinated water; effective sewage; waste management; and resilient systems during floods or displacement. Conflict, poverty, rapid urbanization, and climate variability amplify exposure by disrupting WASH services. Trustworthy governance and transparent communication reduce mortality by promoting early care-seeking and vaccination uptake. The nineteenth-century setting of this print—imperfect drainage, contaminated pumps, class-stratified neighborhoods—mirrors the determinants that continue to define cholera’s geography today.</p>
