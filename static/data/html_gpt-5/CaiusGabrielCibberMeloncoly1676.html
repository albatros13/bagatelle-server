    <h1>Caius Gabriel Cibber, Melancholy (1676)</h1>

    <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
    <p>Caius Gabriel Cibber (1630–1700) was a Danish-born sculptor who built his career in Restoration London and became an influential figure in early British Baroque sculpture. Trained in Northern European traditions yet conversant with Italianate naturalism, he is best known for the paired figures Raving Madness and Melancholy, made of Portland stone for the gates of Bethlem Royal Hospital. Cibber’s attentive modeling of anatomy and affect—visible in the recumbent, introspective figure here—demonstrates his capacity to translate medicalized states into legible sculptural form.</p>

    <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
    <p>Created in 1676, the work belongs to the post–Great Fire, Restoration period under Charles II, when London rebuilt its civic identity and institutions. Bethlem (popularly “Bedlam”) served as England’s principal public madhouse. The statues flanked its Moorfields entrance, encountering promenading Londoners who often paid to view patients inside. The pairing of mania and melancholia reflects a long medical taxonomy of opposites and a public culture that mixed charity, curiosity, and control, revealing how early modern urban life made mental difference both visible and spectacular.</p>

    <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
    <p>Melancholy is shown prone, turned inward, his weight borne on a bent arm, the gaze heavy and withdrawn. The body’s closed, slightly fetal configuration signals psychic contraction, in contrast to the explosive torsion of his pendant Raving figure. Such iconography draws on the classical and Renaissance tradition of melancholia—tied to Saturn, autumnal darkness, and the “black bile” of humoral medicine—yet strips away scholarly attributes (books, astrolabes) to present a destitute inmate. Subtle cues—restraining cloth, shaved or cropped hair, and the slab-like base—place the figure within carceral medicine.</p>

    <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
    <p>Cibber employs Baroque naturalism to stage affect through the body. The diagonal sweep from shoulder to hip, the compressed ribcage, and the tense forearm build a rhythm of contraction. Surface tool marks and deep undercutting catch raking light, heightening chiaroscuro across deltoid and flank. The low, tomb-like plinth collapses pedestal and ground, inviting empathetic proximity rather than triumphal distance. The sculpture thus marries anatomical specificity with compositional restraint to signify inward collapse rather than outward action.</p>

    <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
    <p>The statue materializes inequities baked into early modern psychiatry. Bethlem primarily confined the poor; the comfortable could secure family care, while the indigent were exhibited as moral spectacles. Public viewing normalized surveillance and commodified suffering. The exclusively male figures align disorder with unruly masculinity, sidelining women’s experiences. Philanthropic display at the gate solicited elite donations while reinforcing hierarchies between donors and inmates, shaping a visual regime in which social status mediated who was seen as curable, controllable, or simply pitiable.</p>

    <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
    <p>Historically, melancholia denoted a syndrome of dejection, fear, and fixation attributed to an excess of black bile. Seventeenth-century etiologies combined humors with moral and religious frames (sin, acedia). Contemporary psychiatry would relate this presentation to major depressive disorder and melancholic features: pervasive anhedonia, diurnal variation, psychomotor change, and impaired mood reactivity. Etiology is multifactorial—genetic vulnerability, stress-response dysregulation (HPA axis), monoaminergic signaling, inflammation, and social adversity interact in a biopsychosocial network rather than a single causal chain.</p>

    <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
    <p>Cibber visualizes clinical signs through posture and musculature: psychomotor retardation appears in the slackened limbs and heavy head; reduced engagement is conveyed by the averted, unfocused gaze; self-enclosure, by the drawn-up legs and guarded torso. The clenched forearm hints at inner tension despite global lassitude, a classic melancholic paradox. Textural roughness around the face and shoulders reads as neglect, echoing depressive self-care decline. These choices present a legible diagnostic image long before modern nosology.</p>

    <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
    <p>In Cibber’s day, management ranged from purgatives, bloodletting, and cold immersion to dietary regulation and devotional counsel, with restraint for safety. The enlightenment era introduced “moral treatment,” emphasizing calm environments and routine, though coercion persisted. Modern, evidence-based care combines psychotherapy (CBT, IPT), antidepressant pharmacotherapy, and, for severe melancholia, electroconvulsive therapy—one of the most effective acute interventions. Community-based supports and relapse prevention are crucial, underscoring that humane environments often rival technology in therapeutic impact.</p>

    <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
    <p>Risk for depressive illness is shaped by poverty, unstable housing, discrimination, traumatic exposure, and limited access to care. The Moorfields setting—where the poor were displayed to the city—embodies how stigma and precarity can aggravate illness. Today, equitable access to mental health services, safe work and housing, and anti-stigma policy function as public-health treatments that address the very forces Cibber’s figure silently endures.</p>
