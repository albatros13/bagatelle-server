        <h1>Michelangelo Ecorche (1)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564), a central figure of the Italian Renaissance, is renowned for his mastery across sculpture, painting, and drawing. Among his studio practices was the close study of human anatomy through dissection and ecorché (flayed) drawings. Works of this type, often in red chalk, probe beneath the skin to understand the body as a system of interlocking forms and forces. Whether or not this specific sheet can be tied to a particular commission, it belongs to the tradition of the artist-anatomist that Michelangelo helped legitimize.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Produced within the late fifteenth to early sixteenth century milieu, the drawing reflects the period’s embrace of humanism and empirical observation. Access to hospitals and monastic infirmaries (such as Santo Spirito in Florence) allowed artists and physicians to observe cadavers. The work also participates in a broader European movement that culminated in Vesalius’s De humani corporis fabrica (1543), which displaced scholastic authority with direct anatomical inspection. In workshops, such drawings underpinned the making of sculpture and frescoes by providing reliable knowledge of tension, weight, and bodily proportion.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>An ecorché strips away the integument to reveal the “truth” of structure. In Christian cultures this visual unveiling had a double valence: it affirmed the beauty of divine design while recalling martyrial iconography (for example, the flayed St. Bartholomew), where exposed flesh signifies both suffering and revelation. Here, the absent head and limbs concentrate attention on the torso as the engine of motion—an icon of potency and idealized masculine vigor rather than an individualized portrait.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The sheet demonstrates disegno—the Renaissance ideal of conceptual and linear mastery. Sanguine modeling uses parallel hatching and firm contours to articulate the pectoralis major, deltoid, serratus anterior slips along the rib cage, rectus abdominis segments, external obliques, and the sweeping latissimus dorsi. Volumes are organized in torsion, anticipating contrapposto and rotational dynamics in sculpture. Rhythm is created by the alternation of convex muscle bellies and furrowing tendinous insertions; balance emerges from bilateral symmetry subtly disturbed by anatomical asymmetries observed from life.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Renaissance anatomical access often relied on the bodies of the poor, executed criminals, or unclaimed dead. Such practices reveal class and power imbalances: the knowledge capital accrued by elite artists and physicians derived from marginalized populations. Gendered inequities also marked the archive; male bodies predominated in both practice and representation, shaping ideals of beauty and “normal” anatomy that excluded female physiology. These structural biases influenced pedagogy and canon formation well beyond the sixteenth century.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While the drawing depicts a healthy, idealized musculature, it offers an excellent framework to discuss idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM)—autoimmune diseases such as polymyositis and dermatomyositis that target skeletal muscle. In IIM, immune dysregulation leads to T-cell–mediated muscle fiber injury (polymyositis) or complement-mediated microangiopathy with perifascicular atrophy (dermatomyositis). Environmental triggers (certain infections, drugs, ultraviolet exposure), genetic susceptibility, and autoantibodies (e.g., anti–Jo-1, anti–Mi-2, anti–MDA5) contribute to pathogenesis.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinically, IIM presents with symmetric proximal muscle weakness involving the shoulder and pelvic girdles and trunk—precisely the regions emphasized in ecorché studies. Patients struggle with rising from a chair, lifting the arms, or sustaining neck flexion. Laboratory features include elevated creatine kinase and aldolase; EMG demonstrates myopathic units; MRI (STIR) highlights muscle edema; and biopsy shows endomysial inflammation (polymyositis) or perifascicular atrophy and perivascular inflammation (dermatomyositis). Extra-muscular signs include interstitial lung disease, dysphagia, and, in dermatomyositis, pathognomonic cutaneous findings.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>First-line therapy uses high-dose glucocorticoids with a taper guided by strength and biomarkers. Steroid-sparing agents (methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) are added early; IVIG is effective for refractory disease and for dermatomyositis-associated dysphagia. Biologics (rituximab; emerging JAK inhibitors in select phenotypes) are considered for nonresponders. Supervised exercise and resistance training improve function and mitigate steroid myopathy. Screening and management of interstitial lung disease and malignancy (in dermatomyositis subsets) are integral to care.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Outcomes in myositis track closely with access to specialty care, early diagnostics (MRI, myositis antibody panels, biopsy), pulmonary evaluation, and rehabilitation resources. Occupational exposures and ultraviolet radiation may modulate risk in some phenotypes. Socioeconomic status intersects with diagnostic delay, medication adherence, and nutritional status; rural residence can limit access to centers experienced in rare autoimmune disease. Historically, as with anatomical knowledge itself, inequities in who is studied and who receives care continue to shape epidemiologic understanding and therapeutic justice.</p>
