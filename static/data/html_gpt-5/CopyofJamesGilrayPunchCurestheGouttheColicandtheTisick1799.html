<h1>James Gillray, Punch Cures the Gout, the Colic and the ’Tisick (1799)</h1>

<h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
<p>James Gillray (often spelled “Gilray” in period sources) was the preeminent British caricaturist of the late Georgian era. Trained as an engraver, he combined sharp political wit with technical mastery of etching and hand-colored aquatint. Working with the publisher Hannah Humphrey in London, Gillray’s prints circulated widely, shaping public opinion on politics, manners, and medicine. He refined physiognomic exaggeration into a vehicle for cultural critique, and this print exemplifies his ability to stage a comic scene that doubles as social and medical commentary.</p>

<h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
<p>Published in 1799, the image emerges from a Britain at war with France and saturated with a bustling “medical marketplace” of licensed physicians, apothecaries, patent remedies, and quack nostrums. Punch houses and gin shops had become both convivial spaces and public health concerns. Gout, a so-called “disease of affluence,” was a stock motif of Georgian satire, while respiratory illness (“’tisick,” related to phthisic) and colicky abdominal pain were common in crowded urban settings. The print targets credulous faith in alcohol as a panacea.</p>

<h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
<p>The punch bowl is a talismanic cure-all, its vapors and raised goblets performing a mock-ritual of healing. The corpulent man with padded slippers and bandaged joints personifies gout. The gaunt figure at left, hollow-cheeked and clutching a cup, stands for the ’tisick—historically a term for chronic cough or phthisis (often tuberculosis or asthma-like disease). The central woman, lively and flushed, bridges “the colic,” glossing intestinal spasms or biliary pain. Speech scrolls above each underscore the alchemical promise that punch can cure three disparate ailments, lampooning therapeutic overreach.</p>

<h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
<p>Gillray’s brisk contour lines and dense cross-hatching model form while sustaining cartooned exaggeration. Saturated hand-coloring—rose reds, acid greens, and canary yellows—creates a convivial palette that undercuts the scene’s pathology. The triangular grouping around the round table stabilizes the composition, yet the swelling bandages and bulbous noses push outward, amplifying excess. Text balloons integrate typography with image, a hallmark of satirical prints. Materially, it synthesizes etched line with watercolor, a reproducible medium enabling rapid public circulation and thereby magnifying its didactic sting.</p>

<h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
<p>The print toggles between elite and popular maladies. Gout signified wealth—purine-rich diets and fortified wines—while ’tisick and colic tracked with crowding, poor ventilation, and contaminated food. The female figure’s role as server and participant hints at gendered labor in hospitality trades, where exposure to alcohol and smoke was routine. The satire also marks inequity in medical access: those priced out of physicians turned to convivial remedies and patent cures; the wealthy indulged in drinking cultures that fueled their own illnesses, then sought fashionable treatments.</p>

<h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
<p>Gout is an inflammatory arthritis caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition under conditions of hyperuricemia; risk factors include high-purine diets, alcohol (especially beer and spirits), renal impairment, and certain drugs. “Colic” is a symptom complex of cramping abdominal pain often due to gastrointestinal spasm, biliary stones, or renal stones. “’Tisick,” a period spelling of phthisic, referred to chronic cough and breathlessness—historically tuberculosis or asthma-like disorders. Alcohol neither cures urate crystal inflammation, biliary colic, nor infectious pulmonary disease; it can worsen gout by raising urate and provoking dehydration.</p>

<h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
<p>Visual cues code disease: the gouty figure’s bandaged foot and hands, voluminous slippers, and flushed face signify podagra and inflammatory edema; corpulence emphasizes metabolic excess. The ’tisick figure’s gauntness, sallow tone, and slumped posture suggest cachexia and dyspnea. The central figure’s raised ladle and tight sash evoke abdominal pressure and the promise of relief through drink. Together, these attributes build a semiotics of illness recognizable to 1790s viewers, who would “read” physiognomy as diagnostic.</p>

<h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
<p>Contemporaries tried bleeding, purgatives, blisters, and alcohol-laced cordials; colchicum preparations were emerging. Modern evidence-based care diverges sharply: acute gout is managed with NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids; prevention uses urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) plus dietary moderation and reduced alcohol. Colic management depends on cause—e.g., biliary stones may require cholecystectomy; renal colic uses analgesia and stone-directed therapy. For tuberculosis, curative multi-drug antibiotics are standard; for asthma or chronic bronchitis, inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators improve control. Alcohol is contraindicated as therapy.</p>

<h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
<p>Dietary patterns, alcohol pricing and availability, occupational exposure to smoke, housing density, and ventilation all shape risk. Urban poverty facilitated airborne transmission of tuberculosis; elite dining favored gout. Print culture itself participated in health education: by ridiculing panaceas, Gillray publicized the gap between convivial custom and medical reality, spotlighting structural conditions—work, housing, and market regulation—that underwrote disease patterns in Georgian Britain.</p>
