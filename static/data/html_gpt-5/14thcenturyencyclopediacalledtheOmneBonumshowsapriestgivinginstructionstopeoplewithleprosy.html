        <h1>Omne Bonum shows a priest giving instructions to people with leprosy (14)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This miniature comes from the encyclopedic compilation Omne Bonum, attributed to the London civic official and compiler James le Palmer, and produced by a team of English Gothic scribes and illuminators in the later 14th century. As with many large vernacular and Latin encyclopedias, authorship is collaborative at the level of image-making: a workshop of illuminators translated textual entries into didactic scenes. The image reflects the professional visual language of English manuscript ateliers that served courtly, clerical, and urban patrons.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Omne Bonum was compiled c. 1360–1375, a period marked by the aftershocks of the Black Death, persistent poverty, and expanding lay piety. Although institutional leprosy in Western Europe peaked earlier (12th–13th centuries), it remained socially and legally visible through hospitals (leprosaria), charitable endowments, and ecclesiastical regulations. The Church played a central role in defining the status of people with leprosy, including rites of exclusion and pastoral care. Encyclopedias distilled moral and medical knowledge for clerical readers, and images like this miniature broadcast how authorities expected the afflicted to behave within Christian society.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The spotted faces and hands mark the figures as lepers, a conventional iconographic shorthand for skin disease. The priest’s raised hand, positioned at a lectern, signals instruction and moral authority; his gesture collapses pastoral care, legal restriction, and spiritual admonition into a single didactic moment. The gold ground confers sacred gravitas and frames the interaction as a sanctioned ritual. Grouping the patients together underscores corporate identity—leprosy as a social category—while their attentive postures indicate submission to ecclesial norms.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The miniature employs the International Gothic palette of ultramarine blues, reds, and burnished gold, with crisp ink contours and linear drapery folds. The shallow stage-like space and rounded frame guide the viewer’s focus to gesture and face. Repetition of stippled red dots creates a patterned surface that reads instantly as disease, privileging legibility over naturalism. Rhythm and balance are achieved by the procession of similarly scaled figures approaching the cleric, an arrangement that enacts hierarchy spatially.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Medieval communities often segregated people with leprosy into hospitals outside city walls, restricted their movement, and required distinctive clothing or bells. Charitable endowments could provide food and alms, yet these acts coexisted with stigma and legal marginalization. Gender and class inflected experiences: elite sufferers might secure more comfortable residence and intercessory networks, while the poor faced deeper exclusion. The image naturalizes the asymmetry between institutional authority and the sick, illustrating structural inequities that persist today in different forms where neglected tropical diseases intersect with poverty.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Leprosy (Hansen’s disease) is a chronic infectious disease caused primarily by Mycobacterium leprae, with M. lepromatosis also implicated. It is transmitted through prolonged close contact, likely via respiratory droplets. The bacillus has a predilection for cooler tissues—skin, peripheral nerves, nasal mucosa, and eyes. Incubation is long (typically 5–7 years, but up to 20), which historically obscured routes of transmission and fueled moralized explanations.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinical manifestations range across a spectrum. Paucibacillary (tuberculoid) disease features few hypopigmented or erythematous anesthetic patches and nerve enlargement; multibacillary (lepromatous) disease presents with numerous symmetric lesions, nodules, and diffuse skin infiltration that may produce “leonine facies,” nasal collapse, and eyebrow loss. Peripheral neuropathy leads to sensory loss, ulceration, and deformities of hands and feet. The miniature’s dotted macules compress these varied signs into a single visual code, prioritizing recognizability over specificity yet accurately emphasizing cutaneous involvement.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Medieval remedies combined regimen (diet, baths), topical salves, and prayer, alongside sequestration; none altered the infection’s course. Modern therapy is highly effective: multidrug therapy (MDT) combining rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine cures the disease and halts transmission when taken as directed. Management includes early detection, treatment of immune reactions (e.g., prednisone for neuritis; thalidomide for erythema nodosum leprosum where regulated), eye care, and rehabilitation to prevent disability. Post-exposure prophylaxis for contacts with single-dose rifampicin is endorsed in several programs.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Risk correlates with poverty, household crowding, malnutrition, and limited access to primary health care. Stigma delays care-seeking and increases disability. In the medieval context, religious and civic statutes structured exclusion; today, geography, migration, and health-system capacity shape outcomes. The image reminds us that messaging—who speaks, who listens—can either empower patients or reinforce barriers; equitable control strategies require community engagement, legal protections, and disability-inclusive services.</p>
