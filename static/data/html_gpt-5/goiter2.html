        <h1>goiter (2)</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The work is an uncredited ceramic figurine attributed to a Mesoamerican tradition, likely the West Mexican shaft‑tomb cultures of Jalisco–Nayarit–Colima or a related regional workshop. These communities produced hand-modeled terracottas that recorded aspects of dress, status, ritual practice, and bodily conditions. The figure’s large earspools and coiffure point to a socially marked individual, while the pronounced swelling at the neck suggests an intentional depiction of thyroid enlargement (goiter).
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        The probable date falls between the Late Formative and Early Classic periods, roughly 300 BCE–600 CE. During this era, Western Mexico maintained extensive exchange with coastal zones for obsidian, shell, and salt, while ritual activity centered on ancestor veneration in shaft-tomb complexes. Ceramic portraiture functioned in funerary and domestic shrines, mediating relationships between the living and the dead. In many inland and highland regions of ancient Mesoamerica, environmental iodine scarcity made thyroid disease endemic; thus the appearance of goiter in figural art intersects directly with the lived experiences of these communities.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        Earspools index adulthood, rank, and participation in ceremonial life; their circular voids frame the head as a locus of identity. The open mouth may connote breath, speech, or song in ritual contexts. The enlarged neck, rather than an accidental deformation, reads as an iconographic sign that viewers would recognize, possibly evoking fertility, illness, or divine affliction. In Mesoamerican thought, bodily difference often carried spiritual meaning—illness could signal imbalance requiring ritual negotiation, but also confer special knowledge on afflicted individuals or ritual specialists.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        The figure is hand-built with additive modeling. Smooth planes and restrained incisions yield a volumetric clarity characteristic of West Mexican ceramics. Negative space is exploited in the earspools, while the face emphasizes triangular planes of nose and cheeks. Traces of slip suggest an original polychromy now abraded. The most forceful formal device is the volumetric protrusion at the throat, set against the slender shoulders; this contrast directs the viewer’s gaze to the pathology, balancing idealization with observational realism.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Endemic goiter disproportionately affected inland, mountainous, or floodplain populations where soils were iodine-depleted. Access to marine salt—controlled by elites or traders—created inequalities in nutritional health. Women, especially during pregnancy and lactation, were more vulnerable to iodine deficiency; maternal hypothyroidism risks impaired neurodevelopment in offspring. Thus, the condition indexed broader structural disparities: geography, trade monopolies, gendered labor, and household food distribution.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        Goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. The most common etiology historically was iodine deficiency leading to inadequate thyroid hormone production, pituitary TSH stimulation, and glandular hypertrophy/hyperplasia. Alternative causes include autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease), toxic multinodular goiter, and Graves disease (which may also produce ophthalmopathy). In preindustrial Mesoamerica, the environmental pathway—low dietary iodine coupled with inland residence—best explains endemic, often diffuse goiter. Dietary goitrogens (thiocyanates from some plants) can exacerbate deficiency, though cassava was less central in Mesoamerica than elsewhere.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        The artwork emphasizes an anterior cervical swelling at the level of the thyroid, below the mandible and above the sternum. The mass appears diffuse rather than nodular, aligning with simple or multinodular goiter from chronic iodine deficiency. No exophthalmos or dermal signs are rendered, making Graves disease less likely as an intended referent. Artistic economy—focusing on the neck without exaggerating other features—supports a reading of direct clinical observation translated into recognizable sculptural shorthand.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Historically, empirical remedies included ingestion of marine products (seaweed, shell, fish) and brine, sometimes ritualized. The most effective population intervention is universal salt iodization, now standard global policy. For individuals, correction of deficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, antithyroid therapy for hyperfunctioning goiter, and surgery for compressive or suspicious nodules represent modern care pathways. The figurine’s period predates such biomedical regimens; its very existence underscores the absence of structural iodine provisioning.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Geography (distance from coasts), hydrology (iodine-leached volcanic soils), exchange networks (access to sea salt), status (ability to procure traded minerals), gender (maternal iodine needs), and ritual economies (offerings of salt or seafood) shaped disease prevalence. Political centralization could mitigate risk via redistribution of iodized or marine salt; conversely, fragmented polities intensified local vulnerability. The figure thus documents how environment and economy inscribe themselves onto bodies.
