        <h1>Abdominal incision with a scalpel — colour process print (1926) after a 1345 manuscript illustration</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The original image derives from a mid‑fourteenth‑century European manuscript by an anonymous illuminator working for a medical or university milieu. The 1926 colour process print reproduces that medieval figure, preserving its didactic intent. The scene is commonly associated with the scholastic surgical and anatomical traditions of northern Italy and France, linked to authors such as Mondino de Luzzi and Guy de Chauliac, whose texts circulated with illustrative cycles explaining operative procedures and elementary anatomy.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The manuscript date of 1345 places it on the eve of the Black Death (1347–1351). European universities—Bologna, Montpellier, and Paris—had integrated Arabic-Latin medical learning, while barber‑surgeons provided hands‑on procedures under the oversight of learned physicians. Public or semi‑public anatomical demonstrations, though not yet routine, were becoming more common in Italian centers, often using the bodies of executed criminals or the unclaimed dead. The illustration reflects a transitional moment: scholastic medicine still grounded in Galenic and Avicennian authority, yet increasingly interested in observation through limited dissection.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The operator’s right hand with scalpel and left hand stabilizing the cadaver promise both action and control—manual skill legitimized by learned knowledge. The corpse’s grey, schematic body, set within a coffin-like surround, functions as a memento mori as well as an instructional prop. The frontal, iconic pose and the minimal anatomical detail signal that this is not a forensic portrait but a moralized and didactic image: the body as a text to be “read.” The clean, singular incision at the abdomen connotes the belly as the seat of humors and digestion in medieval physiology.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Linear contour dominates, with flat areas of color, limited shading, and a restricted palette—typical of Gothic manuscript illumination. The figures are hieratic, compressed into a shallow space with a strong vertical axis. Rhythm is created by parallel drapery folds and the rectangular bier, guiding the eye to the knife’s tip. Emphasis is achieved through chromatic contrast: the red sleeve and the tool highlight the operative act. Proportion is schematic rather than naturalistic; anatomy is a conceptual diagram more than a life study, revealing how image conventions served pedagogy.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Access to learned medicine in the fourteenth century was stratified by class and gender. University training excluded most women; barber‑surgeons, often lower in status than physicians, performed the manual labor. Bodies available for dissection disproportionately came from the marginalized—executed criminals, the poor, and the unclaimed—embedding inequity into the production of anatomical knowledge. Urban populations suffered crowded housing, contaminated water, and occupational hazards; elite patients could afford consultation and convalescence, while the poor endured higher mortality and limited care.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While the image is not diagnostic, the focus on opening the abdomen evokes medieval concerns about disorders of digestion and the humors (black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, blood). Etiology was framed by Galenic theory—diet, regimen, and environmental airs—augmented by astrological timing and miasmatic explanations. In the 1340s, recurrent famine and the looming plague shaped understandings of sudden abdominal pain, fevers, or distention. From a modern perspective, conditions that might have motivated abdominal exploration include peritonitis, intestinal obstruction, ruptured hernia, or traumatic injury.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Iconographically, the cadaver’s ashen hue and rigid limbs mark death rather than a specific disease. The chosen incision site—near the lower quadrants—corresponds to access for examining intestines, omentum, or bladder. Medieval texts describe putrefaction, abnormal humoral residues, or intestinal “corruption” as signs encountered during post-mortem teaching. The absence of blood in the picture is conventional, keeping the image legible and emphasizing instruction over spectacle.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Therapeutics combined regimen (diet, sleep, exercise), materia medica (spices, simples, syrups), and procedure. For abdominal trauma or herniation, surgeons recommended cautious incision, evacuation of putrid material, irrigation with wine or vinegar, suturing of peritoneum and skin, and external supports; cautery controlled bleeding. Anesthesia was rudimentary—opiates or soporific sponges—and antisepsis was unknown, making peritoneal procedures highly lethal. The instructional value of dissection lay in familiarizing practitioners with organ positions to improve surgical judgment, even if many intra‑abdominal operations remained contraindicated.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Dietary scarcity following crop failures, contaminated urban water, inadequate waste removal, and the hazards of warfare increased gastrointestinal disease and trauma. Laboring classes faced high exposure to infection and limited rest. Religious and civic regulations governing corpse handling shaped when and where dissections occurred, influencing the accumulation of anatomical knowledge that could, over time, benefit care. The Black Death’s demographic shock further widened disparities, even as it spurred record‑keeping and, eventually, more systematic post‑mortem inquiry.</p>
