        <h2>Louise Bourgeois</h2>

        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
        Louise Bourgeois (1911–2010) was a French‑American sculptor whose practice fused Surrealist legacies with psychoanalytic self‑inquiry. The suspended, polished‑bronze, hyper‑arched figure depicted here relates to her recurring investigations of memory, trauma, and the body, and is often associated with the series and imagery known as “Arch of Hysteria” (1990s). Bourgeois used the human figure to externalize psychic states—fear, desire, anxiety—transforming private experience into sculptural form.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
        In the late twentieth century, artists revisited the medicalized history of “hysteria,” a diagnosis entangled with nineteenth‑century neurology at the Salpêtrière Hospital (Charcot) and early psychoanalysis. By the 1990s, feminist art history had reframed that archive as a theater of the gaze and power. Simultaneously, neurology and psychiatry were rethinking functional neurological symptoms, while contemporary sculpture embraced industrial processes (casting, mirror finishes) and installation strategies such as suspension. Bourgeois’s work channels these debates, folding museum display and clinical spectacle into a single, charged image.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
        The arched, headless body forms an “arc de cercle,” the classic medical pose once photographed as proof of hysteria and also seen in opisthotonus. Headlessness removes individuality, turning the figure into an emblem of embodied affect. Its polished skin mirrors the viewer, implicating us in the act of looking while evoking surgical steel and the clinical apparatus. The suspension line reads as both marionette string and hoist, alluding to control, restraint, and vulnerability. The male anatomy paired with the term “hysteria” overturns the historical feminization of the diagnosis, critiquing gendered assumptions.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
        Bourgeois exploits tension between mass and weightlessness: dense bronze appears to float, creating dynamic negative space within the arch. The high reflectivity multiplies contours, generating rhythm and visual movement across musculature. Balance and proportion are deliberately strained; the figure’s closed loop suggests self‑containment while the outstretched limbs produce a centrifugal pull. Minimal supports and an absent pedestal replace monumentality with precariousness—key to the work’s affective charge.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
        The history of hysteria reveals how women’s pain was pathologized and spectacularized. Clinical photography and teaching theaters made patients into images for predominantly male audiences, shaping inequities that persist in pain assessment, mental‑health stigma, and diagnostic delay—especially for women and marginalized groups. Bourgeois’s reversal—casting a male body into the hysterical arch—exposes the arbitrariness of gendered diagnosis and the authority of the medical gaze.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
        “Hysteria” is now understood primarily as Functional Neurological Disorder (FND), in which motor or sensory symptoms arise from disordered brain‑body prediction and attention rather than structural lesions. Etiology is multifactorial: precipitating stressors, trauma histories, and neurocognitive mechanisms of expectation and salience are implicated. The arched posture also evokes neurological emergencies like opisthotonus in tetanus or severe meningitis, and can resemble postures during certain epileptic seizures—reminding us that similar visual signs may have distinct causes.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
        The sculpture condenses key signifiers: extreme thoracolumbar hyperextension, shoulder retraction, hip extension, plantar flexion, and a taut abdominal wall—features associated with the nineteenth‑century “arc de cercle.” The gleaming surface reads like polished instrument or specimen, linking the body to technologies of observation. Absence of a face erases subjective report, a critique of how symptoms have been validated by visibility rather than patient testimony.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment<br>
        For FND, best practice emphasizes a clear, positive diagnosis; collaborative education; targeted physiotherapy that redirects attention to automatic movement; cognitive‑behavioral or trauma‑informed therapies; and management of comorbid anxiety, depression, or pain. Prognosis improves with early recognition and interdisciplinary care. If the posture were due to tetanus, urgent treatment includes wound care, tetanus immune globulin, antibiotics (e.g., metronidazole), muscle‑spasm control (benzodiazepines), airway support, and vaccination. Epileptic etiologies require seizure‑type–specific antiepileptic therapy. Distinguishing among these possibilities is crucial because management diverges.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
        Access to vaccination and acute care strongly predicts tetanus outcomes, disproportionately affecting low‑resource settings. For FND, social determinants—trauma exposure, gender‑based violence, chronic stress, insecure employment and housing, and barriers to mental‑health services—shape onset and recovery. Historical biases that dismissed women’s and minorities’ symptoms as “psychogenic” continue to influence referral patterns and lengthen time to appropriate treatment. Bourgeois’s work materializes these determinants as a suspended equilibrium between support and abandonment.</p>
