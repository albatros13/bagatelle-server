    <h1>Hubert Airy Depiction of Scotomas / Transient Hemiopsia (1870)</h1>

    <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
    <p>Hubert Airy (1838–1903) was a British physician whose meticulous drawings of his own visual aura helped establish the iconography of migraine. Trained in medicine yet comfortable with the precision of scientific illustration, Airy translated neurological experience into diagrammatic form. His plates, published with the Royal Society, bridged the observational practices of Victorian science and the emergent clinical neurology of the late nineteenth century. Airy’s hybrid role—patient, observer, and draughtsman—makes this image a rare convergence of subjective phenomenology and objective visualization.</p>

    <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
    <p>Produced in 1870, the work belongs to a period when British science prized exact description and the diagram as evidence. Photography was not well suited to internal percepts, so drawings carried epistemic authority. Neurology was coalescing as a discipline, and debates over “nervous” illnesses intersected with Victorian anxieties about productivity, gender, and willpower. Airy’s publication in Philosophical Transactions situated migraine within serious scientific discourse rather than moral weakness or hysteria, anticipating twentieth-century neurophysiology and the modern clinic’s emphasis on standardized symptom description.</p>

    <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
    <p>The image presents crenellated, zigzag forms—“fortification spectra” or teichopsia—expanding across a dark field. The black ground operates as the visual field; the jagged, luminous borders signify scintillation. Airy’s small numbered vignettes map temporal stages of aura, from central flicker to enlarging C-shaped scotoma that migrates toward the periphery. Subtle prismatic hues along the edges denote chromatic scintillation, echoing diffraction and optical science. While diagrammatic, the forms evoke defense walls and breach, metaphorizing the invasion of vision by neurological disturbance.</p>

    <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
    <p>Airy deploys high contrast, repetition, and scale shift to communicate motion through time. Line is paramount: serrated, rhythmic strokes create a pulsatile boundary, while gradated shading suggests a penumbra of impaired seeing. Negative space is an active element, a void that stands for visual loss. Sequential arrangement functions like a storyboard, an innovation in rendering a dynamic symptom. The measured regularity reflects Victorian drafting conventions, yet the image remains affective, translating subjective discomfort into a precise visual grammar.</p>

    <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
    <p>Nineteenth-century discourse often framed migraine as a malady of delicate women or overworked intellectuals, reinforcing gendered and classed stereotypes. Such framings obscured prevalence across laboring populations and discouraged care-seeking. Contemporary disparities persist: women, people with lower income, and some racial and ethnic minorities face underdiagnosis, limited access to specialists, and high costs for new therapies. Airy’s authoritative platform contrasts with less-heard patient voices; placing this image within history prompts reflection on whose experiences are archived as evidence.</p>

    <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
    <p>The condition depicted is migraine with visual aura. Auras are transient neurological symptoms (typically 5–60 minutes) preceding or accompanying headache. Current evidence implicates cortical spreading depression (CSD)—a self-propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarization—originating in the occipital cortex and traveling at roughly 3 mm/min, mirroring the spatial-temporal march of Airy’s figures. Head pain arises from activation of the trigeminovascular system and release of neuropeptides such as CGRP, producing neurogenic inflammation and central sensitization. Genetic susceptibility is polygenic; rare monogenic forms (e.g., familial hemiplegic migraine) implicate ion channel and transporter genes.</p>

    <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
    <p>Clinical signifiers include scintillating zigzag lines, enlarging scotoma, and homonymous distribution (the same side of the visual field in both eyes), reflecting retinotopic mapping in visual cortex. Patients often describe shimmering, saw-toothed arcs—precisely the crenellations Airy renders. Additional features may include photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea, with headache following or, in acephalgic cases, absent. The systematic progression across the plate visualizes diagnostic criteria: gradual spread, sequential symptoms, and full reversibility.</p>

    <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
    <p>Acute treatment includes NSAIDs, triptans, and antiemetics; newer options are gepants (ubrogepant, rimegepant, zavegepant) and the 5-HT1F agonist lasmiditan. Preventive strategies range from beta-blockers and topiramate to onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine and monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway (erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab, eptinezumab). Nonpharmacologic measures—regular sleep, exercise, hydration, trigger management, and cognitive-behavioral strategies—improve outcomes. Clinicians monitor for medication overuse headache and tailor therapy to comorbidities, pregnancy status, and patient preference.</p>

    <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
    <p>Work demands, shift schedules, low job control, light/noise exposure, food insecurity, and limited access to specialist care shape migraine frequency and disability. Insurance coverage and drug pricing constrain uptake of CGRP-targeted agents, while transportation and caregiving burdens complicate consistent follow-up. Public health approaches that address workplace accommodations, equitable access to evidence-based therapies, and culturally competent education can reduce differential burden.</p>
