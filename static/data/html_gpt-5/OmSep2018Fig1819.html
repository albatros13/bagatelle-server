        <h2>Om Sep2018 Fig1819</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The plate juxtaposes two Northern and Italian Renaissance masters. On the left is Domenico Ghirlandaio, a leading Florentine painter whose workshop trained Michelangelo and excelled in lifelike portraiture. On the right is Marinus van Reymerswaele, a Netherlandish specialist in satirical scenes of bankers and tax collectors. Though unrelated in geography, both artists cultivated observational acuity, rendering textures, physiognomies, and minute material details that make their paintings unusually valuable as historical records of disease phenotypes.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>Ghirlandaio’s panel (c. 1490) belongs to the Quattrocento, when Florentine humanism embraced empirical looking and individualized portraiture within domestic virtue. The background window and calm geometry reflect an orderly civic ethos. Reymerswaele’s work (mid-16th century) emerges from the mercantile Low Countries amid Reformation ferment and expanding financial bureaucracy. His interiors teem with ledgers, coins, and papers, indicting greed while showcasing Northern precision. Both contexts privileged visual truthfulness, enabling faithful depiction of cutaneous conditions that today invite dermatologic interpretation.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>In Ghirlandaio, the tender gaze between elder and child communicates lineage and caritas; the ruined yet magnificently individualized nose underscores memento mori and acceptance of bodily imperfection. The landscape glimpsed through the window signals the broader world and time’s passage. Reymerswaele’s mise-en-scène uses cluttered account books, scales, and fur-lined garments to personify Avarice and folly. The sitter’s pitted facial skin functions doubly: a mark of mortality and a satirical cue that moral corruption coexists with corporeal blemish—a common rhetorical device in Northern moralizing art.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>Ghirlandaio balances stable pyramidal composition and cool daylight modeling with tactile paint handling: the red garments, soft curls, and delicate skin transitions heighten naturalism. Linearity and controlled perspective create clarity without idealization. Reymerswaele pushes texture and chromatic contrast—acid greens and reds, fur, parchment, and glinting metal—within a compressed space that generates psychological tension. His caricatural physiognomies amplify narrative while remaining rooted in observed detail. In both, surface description becomes a vehicle for truth-telling, including dermatologic specificity.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Facial difference historically invited stigma. Rhinophyma was long misattributed to drunkenness, casting moral blame on affected individuals. Acne scarring likewise carried associations with uncleanliness or youth impropriety. The tax-collector theme overlays economic inequity—extraction from the poor—onto the sitter’s corporeal marks. These works thus register how bodies become sites where moral judgments and social hierarchies are projected, shaping access to care, marriage prospects, and occupational acceptance.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The elder’s nose shows lobulated enlargement, bulbosity, and surface irregularity consistent with rhinophyma, a phymatous subtype of rosacea characterized by sebaceous gland hyperplasia, connective-tissue overgrowth, and chronic inflammation. Contemporary research implicates dysregulated innate immunity, neurovascular reactivity, Demodex mite overabundance, and microbial shifts; alcohol is not a causative factor though it may trigger flushing. In Reymerswaele, the sharply indented “icepick” pits on the face correspond to atrophic acne scars, sequelae of inflammatory acne in which follicular rupture and matrix degradation lead to vertical collagen loss and narrow scar tracts.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Ghirlandaio renders telangiectatic surface and nodular lobes with pores accentuated by raking light, matching clinical rhinophyma presentations. The surrounding skin lacks jaundice or edema, focusing the viewer on phymatous change. Reymerswaele’s sitter displays multiple small, sharply demarcated depressions typical of icepick scars, potentially accompanied by boxcar variants; their distribution on temple and cheek aligns with high-sebum zones. The artists’ scrupulous detailing allows cautious retrospective diagnosis while acknowledging artistic mediation.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Renaissance therapeutics, grounded in humoral theory, offered astringents and cautery but little durable benefit. Modern care for rosacea employs trigger avoidance; topical metronidazole, azelaic acid, ivermectin; oral tetracyclines for inflammatory control; and for rhinophyma, surgical debulking via scalpel, electrosurgery, dermabrasion, or CO₂/erbium lasers to recontour nasal architecture. Acne management aims to reduce inflammation and comedogenesis through topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, and oral isotretinoin for severe cases. Established atrophic scars respond to TCA CROSS, microneedling, subcision, fractional lasers, or combined protocols tailored to scar type and skin tone.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Chronic facial dermatoses intersect with occupation (public-facing work), climate and sun exposure, access to dermatologic care, and cultural myths linking skin disease to vice. Financial means shape availability of procedural treatments; darker phototypes face laser risk disparities due to underrepresentation in trials. Psychosocial impacts—shame, isolation, and reduced earning potential—can perpetuate a loop of stress-driven flares. These paintings foreshadow modern recognition that equitable outcomes demand both medical therapy and stigma reduction.</p>
