        <h1>Scurvy</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            This painting is commonly attributed to the American medical illustrator Robert A. Thom (1915–1979), whose mid‑20th‑century History of Medicine series visualized pivotal episodes in clinical discovery. Whether by Thom or a contemporary working in the same vein, the piece belongs to a tradition of didactic historical illustration aimed at educating lay and professional audiences about medical breakthroughs. The artist synthesizes documentary details of shipboard life with a narrative focus on patient care, using realism to bridge art and pedagogy.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            The scene evokes the Age of Sail in the 18th century, when prolonged oceanic voyages produced staggering mortality from scurvy among sailors, soldiers, and transported peoples. Maritime provisioning relied on salted meat and hardtack, foods devoid of vitamin C, while fresh produce spoiled quickly at sea. Enlightenment empiricism catalyzed shipboard trials of antiscorbutic foods, and by the late 18th to early 19th century, routine citrus rations dramatically reduced deaths in navies and merchant fleets. The painting’s lantern-lit hold, hammocks, and uniforms situate viewers in that transitional moment when observation, dietetics, and logistics converged to alter global seafaring.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
            The jug or bowl of liquid positioned at the bedside functions as an icon of citrus-derived remedies, while the prostrate sailors, pallid and weakened, embody the corporeal toll of deficiency. Lanterns signify enlightenment and evidence brought to bear in dark conditions, a metaphor for medical reasoning amid uncertainty. The ship’s beams frame the figures in a constrained grid, underscoring the captivity of bodies to environment and supply chains. Uniformed attendants and a standing officer mark authority and institutional response, while the red deck reads as both practical paint and a chromatic hint of hemorrhage.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            The composition employs a shallow, longitudinal perspective, guiding the eye through receding diagonals of bunks. Controlled chiaroscuro concentrates light on the patient-physician nexus, turning a crowded ward into a clear narrative focal point. Naturalistic anatomy, textured brushwork on wood and cloth, and calibrated color temperature (cool greys versus warm skin tones) heighten immediacy. Balance arises from alternating vertical posts and supine bodies, while rhythm is created by repeated lanterns and limbs; together they convey order imposed on crisis.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            Scurvy thrived where structural inequities dictated rations and risk: low-ranking sailors, enslaved persons, prisoners, and migrants endured cramped holds, monotony of diet, and limited agency. The hierarchy evident in the scene reflects who controlled provisioning and who bore the bodily costs of scarcity. Colonial extraction prioritized durable commodities over nutritional adequacy, and knowledge transfer was uneven—folk wisdom about fresh plants often failed to influence policy until elite institutions validated it. The work thus visualizes how class, labor, and empire mediated exposure to deficiency disease.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            Scurvy results from prolonged deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid), an essential cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases in collagen biosynthesis. Humans lack gulonolactone oxidase and cannot synthesize ascorbate endogenously. Depletion impairs stable collagen cross-linking, weakening capillaries, gingiva, bone, and wound matrices. Additional roles for vitamin C include catecholamine synthesis and antioxidant defense. Clinical onset typically follows one to three months of inadequate intake (<10 mg/day), accelerated by infections, physical stress, smoking, alcohol use, or malabsorption.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Hallmark features include gingival swelling and bleeding, perifollicular hemorrhages with corkscrew hairs, ecchymoses, petechiae, hyperkeratosis, arthralgias, anemia, and fatigue. Children may develop bone pain and impaired growth; adults often exhibit poor wound healing and edema. In the image, recumbent, wasted bodies, assisted hydration, and attendants’ concern suggest hemorrhagic weakness and orthostatic intolerance. The contrast between bare torsos and clothed officials also reads as a visual cue to vulnerability and debility.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Treatment is repletion with vitamin C. For adults, 100–300 mg/day of ascorbic acid in divided doses typically reverses symptoms within days and resolves most signs within weeks; prevention requires roughly 10–20 mg/day, though 75–90 mg/day is recommended for general health. Historically, citrus juice or fresh produce accomplished this; today, options include fruits (citrus, berries, kiwifruit), vegetables (peppers, brassicas), fortified foods, or supplements. Supportive care addresses anemia, pain, and infections. Cooking and storage matter: ascorbate is heat‑labile and water‑soluble, so minimal processing preserves efficacy.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Risk clusters where fresh foods are inaccessible: food deserts, displacement and forced migration, institutional settings, extreme poverty, substance use disorders, restrictive or highly processed diets, and diseases that limit absorption or appetite. On ships, the determinants were logistical—lack of refrigeration, long intervals between ports, and rigid rationing. Modern analogs include homelessness, isolation among elders, and emergency contexts where supply chains favor shelf-stable calories over micronutrients. Effective prevention therefore couples clinical screening with procurement policies that guarantee vitamin C–rich options.
