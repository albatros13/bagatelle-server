        <h1>Child of Migrant Family Suffering from Tuberculosis of the Bone, California</h1>
        <p><em>Captioned photograph attributed to Dorothea Lange.</em></p>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Dorothea Lange was a leading American documentary photographer associated with the Farm Security Administration (FSA). Her work fused formal acuity with social purpose, producing images that shaped public understanding of poverty, migration, and labor in the United States during the 1930s and early 1940s. Working within a federally funded program, Lange framed individual lives as lenses onto broader structural conditions, a hallmark of documentary modernism.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The photograph originates in the Great Depression era, when drought and economic collapse displaced hundreds of thousands of families to the agricultural valleys of California. These “migrant” communities often lived in transient camps with overcrowding, poor sanitation, and precarious employment. New Deal agencies commissioned photographers to create a visual archive that could guide relief policy and generate public empathy, embedding the image within a documentary project of social reform.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>Lange’s caption directs the viewer’s reading: a child in a migrant family is described as suffering from “tuberculosis of the bone.” Iconographically, the roadside setting, packed vehicle, and makeshift supports communicate displacement and fragility. The crutches function less as medical evidence than as a visual signifier of impairment within the documentary tradition, while the open road suggests both mobility and exposure. These motifs collectively signal the vulnerability of itinerant life.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The composition balances close human presence with expansive space. Strong diagonals of the road and vehicle contour lead the eye toward the central figure, while natural light modulates a wide grayscale, producing tactile textures in clothing, wood, and dirt. Lange’s characteristic directness—unmanipulated light, minimal staging, shallow narrative context—invites ethical attention rather than sensationalism. The image employs contrast and rhythm to create a quiet, insistent gravity.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Migrant families faced exclusionary residency rules, episodic wages, and limited access to clinical care. Charity hospitals were overburdened; transportation and documentation barriers compounded delays in diagnosis. Children were particularly affected by malnutrition and interrupted schooling. The photograph bears witness to the intersection of labor precarity and health vulnerability, highlighting how disability and disease could be intensified by poverty, housing insecurity, and the absence of public health infrastructure.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Osteoarticular tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, typically spreading hematogenously from a primary pulmonary focus to bones and joints. In children, richly vascular metaphyseal regions and the spine are commonly involved. The disease progresses insidiously, producing granulomatous inflammation, caseous necrosis, and bone destruction; in spinal involvement (Pott disease), vertebral collapse and deformity may occur. Transmission is airborne from individuals with active pulmonary TB; skeletal involvement is a secondary manifestation.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinically, osteoarticular TB often presents with localized pain, swelling, limited range of motion, chronic draining sinuses, and, in spinal cases, kyphotic deformity and neurological risk. The documentary signifiers in this image—such as supportive devices and guarded posture—communicate impairment within the picture’s narrative and caption. While those visual elements are not diagnostic on their own, they operate as representational cues that align with the documented challenges associated with musculoskeletal TB.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the 1930s, before effective antibiotics, recommended care emphasized rest, immobilization, nutritional support, and, when necessary, surgical drainage or debridement; prolonged sanatorium stays were common. Modern treatment consists of multi-drug antitubercular therapy (e.g., isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) typically for 6–12 months, tailored to drug-susceptibility testing. Surgical intervention is reserved for abscess, severe deformity, instability, or neurological compromise. Public health measures—contact tracing, adherence support, and improved living conditions—are essential adjuncts.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Osteoarticular TB tracks closely with crowding, poor ventilation, malnutrition, and delayed access to care—conditions historically prevalent in migrant encampments. Economic instability limits diagnostic continuity and completion of lengthy treatment regimens. Environmental exposure, mobility, and stigma can further impede follow-up. The image, contextualized by its caption, underscores how structural determinants—labor exploitation, housing insecurity, and uneven state support—shape individual disease trajectories.</p>
