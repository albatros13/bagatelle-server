        <h1>Death of Marat Davin</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Jacques-Louis David, a central figure of French Neoclassicism, is credited with this canonical composition. Trained in the rigorous academic tradition yet politically attuned, David fused classical clarity with modern revolutionary subject matter, shaping visual culture in late eighteenth-century France.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted in 1793, during the radical phase of the French Revolution, the work participates in the formation of civic virtue through imagery. The upheavals of the period—collapse of the ancien régime, mass mobilization, and the Terror—generated an urgent need for public icons. David, serving revolutionary committees, supplied a modern history painting that functioned like a secular altarpiece, commemorating a recently slain political actor and instructing citizens in the values of sacrifice and steadfastness.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The pared-down setting—a wooden crate as desk, a damp green cloth, the bath as makeshift workplace—signals austerity and service to the public good. The outstretched arm holding a letter evokes the giving of testimony, while the quill, inkwell, and paper underscore the power of the written word in revolutionary politics. Art-historically, the pose and lighting recall Christian pietà and deposition imagery, repositioning a contemporary subject within a lineage of martyrdom. Blood is minimized, channeling attention to moral meaning rather than gore; the knife’s absence from the body, placed aside, turns the scene into a meditative relic of a completed act.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Neoclassical economy governs the composition: planar forms, controlled contour, lucid edges, and an architecture of diagonals stabilize the scene. A restricted palette of warm flesh against cool greens and browns produces chromatic sobriety. Tenebrism isolates the figure against a dark void, guiding the eye along a clear hierarchy—from face to hand to letter. Texture is sparing; the waxen light imparts an idealized, sculptural surface that abstracts the body into a moral sign rather than a portrait from life. Balance arises from the counterweight of the crate and the green cloth, while negative space amplifies solemnity.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting addresses inequities central to the Revolution: privilege versus the claims of the people, access to print culture, and the vulnerability of bodies amid political violence. It simultaneously reveals medical inequities—limited care, improvised therapies, and the dependence on self-treatment in cramped urban quarters. David’s visual rhetoric ennobles a body marked by illness, insisting that civic virtue is not constrained by health or class resources.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Contemporary accounts describe a chronic, intensely pruritic dermatosis that compelled the sitter to work from a medicinal bath. Etiologies debated by historians and clinicians include scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei infestation), dermatitis herpetiformis (an autoimmune blistering disorder associated with gluten sensitivity), chronic atopic dermatitis, or psoriasis. Scabies aligns with eighteenth-century sulfur-based treatments and crowded living conditions; dermatitis herpetiformis fits severe itch with relief from cool immersion; atopic dermatitis or psoriasis account for chronic relapsing inflammation exacerbated by stress. Given evidence constraints, a differential diagnosis remains most responsible.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>While David suppresses visible lesions, the iconography encodes disease: the bath as therapeutic vessel; head wrap as compress; the posture of fatigue; and writing tools positioned for use without leaving the water. The idealized epidermis serves a political purpose, yet the clinical narrative persists through props and spatial logic—an image of functional impairment mitigated by continuous symptomatic care.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Eighteenth-century management relied on topical sulfur and sulfurated baths (antiparasitic and keratolytic), vinegar or alum astringents, herbal emollients, and linen dressings. For scabies, sulfur ointments remain historically standard; for dermatitis herpetiformis, modern therapy employs dapsone and a gluten-free diet—options unavailable then. Supportive measures such as cool immersion to blunt pruritus, avoidance of irritants in coarse textiles, and hygienic laundering would have been variably accessible. David’s staging captures continuous hydrotherapy as a pragmatic, home-based regimen.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Urban crowding, fluctuating food supply, stress from political persecution, and inconsistent access to trained physicians shaped disease expression and outcomes. Textile scarcity and infrequent laundering promoted ectoparasite transmission; limited privacy impeded sustained treatment; and ideological labor demands overrode convalescence. The painting therefore documents not just a clinical condition but the ecology of illness under revolutionary modernity.</p>
