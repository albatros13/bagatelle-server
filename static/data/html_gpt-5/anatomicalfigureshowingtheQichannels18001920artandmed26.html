        <h1>Qi channels (1800–1920)</h1>

        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
        The object is likely the product of a Qing-dynasty or early Republican Chinese workshop specializing in medical teaching aids. Such models were carved by artisan–scribes who combined craft skills with medical literacy, inscribing canonical meridians and acupoint names onto bone, ivory, or wood. The anonymity of the maker reflects the collaborative nature of traditional medical production in which physicians, carvers, and book illustrators translated classical texts into tactile pedagogical tools for apprentices and patients.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
        Dated broadly to 1800–1920, the figure sits at the transition from late imperial to modern medicine in China. Urban clinics, pharmacy halls, and examination culture shaped medical authority, while print atlases standardized meridian nomenclature. During this period, acupuncture experienced cycles of prestige and skepticism, then a revival linked to reformist interest in national heritage. Models like this circulated through ports and missions, entering Western museums and fueling comparative anatomy debates, even as biomedicine gained influence in treaty-port hospitals.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
        The incised lines map the body’s jingluo—channels through which qi and blood circulate. Points are named metaphorically as wells, streams, and gates, echoing a cosmology in which the human form mirrors rivers and governance. The midline tracks signify the Conception and Governing vessels, axial routes that organize yin–yang polarity. Characters near the face mark sensory orifices, loci of spirit exchange. The polished, pale surface evokes purity and the idealized, non-individual body: a template for harmonizing internal organs (zang-fu) with seasonal and environmental rhythms.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
        The body is schematized rather than naturalistic: planar limbs, simplified musculature, and high-contrast dark incisions emphasize linearity over volume. Repetition and rhythm arise from regularly spaced points along sweeping curves. Balance is achieved through bilateral symmetry, while proportion is subordinated to didactic clarity—channels remain readable across the figure’s abbreviated torso and extremities. The tight drawing and calligraphic strokes fuse visual and textual registers, a hallmark of Chinese medical illustration where writing operates as pictorial form.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
        Material choice (often ivory or bone) implicates global commodity chains and hierarchies; finely carved models catered to elite physicians and collectors, while cheaper wood copies served apprentices. Gendered access to training limited who could handle such tools. Colonial collecting practices displaced many models from clinical settings into cabinets of curiosity, reframing living knowledge as ethnographic specimen. Contemporary debates about heritage, animal conservation, and restitution further entangle the object in inequities beyond its original therapeutic intent.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
        The model encodes disease as imbalance rather than discrete lesions. Etiologies include external “winds” (environmental insults like cold-damp), internal emotions disrupting organ systems, dietary irregularity, and trauma leading to qi stagnation and blood stasis. In biomedicine, conditions commonly addressed along these channels include musculoskeletal pain, neuropathies, postoperative nausea, and headaches. Mechanistic proposals emphasize neuromodulation: needling activates A-delta and C fibers, influences dorsal horn gating, engages limbic–hypothalamic circuits, and triggers local adenosine release, collectively altering pain processing and autonomic tone.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
        Clinically, the channels provide diagnostic maps: tenderness along a pathway, temperature changes, or nodules indicate stagnation; pulse qualities and tongue features corroborate pattern differentiation. For example, lateral arm pain and facial symptoms might be interpreted via the Large Intestine channel trajectory, whereas midline epigastric discomfort engages the Conception vessel. The model’s inscribed points thus function as semiotic nodes—sites where symptom narratives, palpatory findings, and therapeutic intervention converge.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment<br>
        Interventions implied by the figure include acupuncture, moxibustion (heat applied with Artemisia), and acupressure. Contemporary practice adds electrical stimulation and standardized clean-needle technique to minimize infection. Evidence supports acupuncture for chronic primary pain syndromes, knee osteoarthritis, tension-type headache, migraine prophylaxis, and postoperative or chemotherapy-induced nausea, with effect sizes modest but clinically meaningful and safety favorable when performed by trained practitioners. Treatment selection follows pattern diagnosis (e.g., moving qi for stagnation) alongside biomedical assessment to rule out red flags.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
        The channels also index lived environments: labor intensity, housing, cold exposure, diet, and psychosocial stress shape patterns like cold-damp arthralgia or qi constraint. Access to trained providers, language concordance, and insurance coverage determine who benefits from such care. Migration and urban pollution alter respiratory and inflammatory burdens, prompting adaptive point prescriptions but also highlighting structural needs—heating, clean air, safe work—that lie beyond the clinic.</p>
