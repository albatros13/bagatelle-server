        <h1>Melanoma</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The painting is a late eighteenth-century court portrait by the Spanish artist Francisco de Goya y Lucientes. Goya, trained in Zaragoza and active in Madrid, bridged the worlds of courtly service and biting social critique. As First Court Painter, he adapted the grand manner inherited from Velázquez while introducing a frank, modern psychological scrutiny. His independence of vision and painterly audacity make him a pivotal figure between the Enlightenment and early modern art, and his court portraits often double as social documents.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        Painted around 1800, the work emerges from a Spain negotiating Enlightenment reforms, entrenched aristocratic privilege, and mounting geopolitical pressures. Court portraiture served dynastic propaganda, asserting legitimacy through display, heraldry, and ceremony. Yet the period also witnessed growing skepticism toward absolutism, scientific curiosity, and medical cataloguing of the body. Artists and physicians alike became observers of empirical detail. In this milieu, the court image functions both as public theater of power and as a dense archive of material culture, fashion, and corporeality on the eve of Napoleonic disruptions.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        Sashes, jeweled orders, and brocades announce rank and allegiance; the grouping affirms dynastic continuity through intergenerational proximity. Mirrors and background canvases, recalling the precedent of Las Meninas, stage a meta-commentary on representation and authority. Light isolates faces and hands—the loci of identity and agency—while darker recesses imply the ambiguity of power. In medical iconography, exposed skin surfaces, moles, and color shifts occasionally become inadvertent signifiers that modern viewers read for disease. Such readings must remain cautious, yet they reveal how art can preserve somatic clues across centuries.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        The composition is frontal and processional, with a shallow stage-like depth that brings figures into the viewer’s space. Goya’s brushwork oscillates between satin-like finish in insignia and a bravura, flickering handling in flesh and fabric highlights. Warm golds and reds dominate, countered by cool silvers and blues of orders and ribbons, creating chromatic tension that emphasizes hierarchy. Chiaroscuro guides attention to physiognomies, whose individualized modeling resists idealization. The painter’s economy of mark—especially in faces—suggests lived bodies rather than porcelain effigies, allowing contemporary medical readers to note pigmentation, asymmetry, and texture.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        The canvas dramatizes class structures: opulent textiles, imported luxuries, and heraldic devices contrast with invisible labor and colonial extraction that financed them. Health inequities are implicit: elites could access physicians and emerging diagnostic knowledge, while the poor faced barriers to care. Gendered constraints are legible in restrictive fashion and reproductive expectations. Even within privilege, understanding of cancer was rudimentary, and treatments were perilous; the work thus stages a world where status mitigated but did not eliminate vulnerability to disease.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        Melanoma is a malignant neoplasm of melanocytes arising in cutaneous, mucosal, or ocular sites. Etiology is multifactorial: intermittent, intense ultraviolet exposure (especially UVB), fair phototype with poor tanning response, multiple or atypical nevi, family history, high-penetrance germline variants (e.g., CDKN2A), immunosuppression, and environmental factors. Pathogenesis involves DNA damage, driver mutations (BRAF V600, NRAS, NF1, KIT), and evasion of immune surveillance. Historically, the disease was poorly distinguished from other “black tumors,” but contemporary oncology recognizes discrete molecular subtypes with differing behaviors and therapy responsiveness.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Modern clinical heuristics such as the ABCDE criteria—Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variegation, Diameter greater than 6 mm, and Evolution—aid detection. The “ugly duckling” sign highlights discordant lesions relative to an individual’s nevus pattern. Nodular melanoma can present as rapidly enlarging, dome-shaped lesions; amelanotic variants lack pigment and risk delayed diagnosis. Metastatic spread commonly involves sentinel lymph nodes, skin, lung, liver, brain. In historical portraiture, artists sometimes recorded distinctive pigmented macules or periocular discolorations; while intriguing, retrospective diagnosis from painted surfaces remains speculative and must be framed as iconographic, not clinical, interpretation.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        The cornerstone for localized disease is wide local excision with margins guided by Breslow depth and consideration of sentinel lymph node biopsy for staging. For advanced disease, immunotherapies—anti–PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) and anti–CTLA-4 (ipilimumab), alone or in combination—have transformed survival. Targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors benefits tumors harboring BRAF V600 mutations. Adjuvant systemic therapy reduces recurrence risk in high-stage cases. Dermoscopy, total-body photography, and patient education support early detection. Historical treatments—cautery, caustics, bloodletting—were largely ineffective and underscore the progress of evidence-based oncology.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Melanoma risk and outcomes are shaped by latitude, outdoor labor, access to sunscreen and shade, cultural norms about tanning and fashion, health literacy, and insurance coverage. Light-skinned populations at sunny latitudes face elevated incidence; rurality and poverty can delay biopsy and specialist referral, worsening stage at diagnosis. Conversely, people with darker skin often confront under-recognition, contributing to later presentation and poorer prognosis. Portraits of elites idealizing pallor hint at historical photoprotection through indoor life, parasols, and layered clothing—an early, class-mediated “intervention” unevenly distributed across society.
