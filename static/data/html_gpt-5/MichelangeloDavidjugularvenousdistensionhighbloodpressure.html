        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564), the preeminent sculptor of the Italian High Renaissance, carved David from a single, previously abandoned marble block between 1501 and 1504. Renowned for anatomical acuity acquired through drawing and dissection, Michelangelo conceived the figure not as a post-victory hero but as a tense, vigilant youth. The work demonstrates his belief that ideal beauty emerges by “releasing” the form within marble, fusing classical models with intensely observed human physiology, from contracting muscles to subtly engorged superficial veins.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>David was executed in republican Florence after the turmoil of the Savonarolan period and amidst power struggles with Medici factions. Commissioned by the Opera del Duomo and ultimately installed before the Palazzo Vecchio (1504), the statue became a civic emblem of the Florentine Republic’s vigilance. The time is marked by humanist scholarship, the revival of antique statuary, and workshop-based anatomical study long before Harvey’s 1628 description of the circulation. Within this milieu, Michelangelo synthesized classical ideals with empirical observation, projecting moral and civic resolve through the living body.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>Iconographically, David embodies the biblical shepherd poised before confronting Goliath, identified by the sling laid along his shoulder and the stone held in his right hand. The head’s concentrated gaze and straining neck signify psychological alertness. In civic terms, David symbolizes the small but cunning city-state defending liberty against larger powers. Physiological details—such as the visible external jugular vein—are iconographic amplifiers of the moment just before action, translating inner resolve into corporeal signs of heightened arousal and breath control.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The statue exemplifies High Renaissance ideals: harmonious proportion, contrapposto, and unity of mass. Michelangelo manipulates scale (enlarged hands and head) to correct for a low viewing angle and to emphasize agency and thought. Value and texture are modulated through polished planes and crisp drillwork in hair. The diagonal sweep from shoulders to hips creates rhythm and expectation, while anatomical passages—sternocleidomastoid tension, pectoral lift, and venous tracery—integrate line, volume, and implied motion. The marble’s translucency enhances lifelike surface modeling.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>David projects a civic ideal coded as male, youthful, and able-bodied. Such state symbols historically excluded women, the elderly, and those with disabilities from the visual language of power. The whiteness of marble became conflated with ideals of purity in later European reception, contributing to racialized hierarchies of beauty. Access to patronage, training, and public honor was similarly unequal in Renaissance Florence. Today, museum stewardship and conservation further shape who encounters the work and under what interpretive frames, often privileging well-resourced institutions and audiences.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Jugular venous distension (JVD) refers to visible engorgement of the jugular veins, often the external jugular, reflecting elevated venous pressure. Pathological etiologies include right-sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation or stenosis, pericardial tamponade, and tension pneumothorax. Physiologically, the jugulars may transiently distend during the Valsalva maneuver, strenuous isometric effort, or emotional arousal, when intrathoracic pressure rises and venous return is impeded. The artwork’s biomedical interest lies in its unusually precise depiction of a superficially coursing external jugular vein and adjacent neck musculature under sympathetic activation.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the sculpture, a prominent superficial vein runs obliquely over the sternocleidomastoid, with the muscle itself taut—consistent with head rotation and inspiratory preparation. The chest is lifted and the lips set, suggesting a breath held before release. Absence of generalized edema or facial plethora, along with athletic habitus, argues against chronic venous hypertension. Thus, the venous prominence is most plausibly a physiologic signifier of momentary strain, not disease: a brilliant artistic choice that externalizes psychological tension through vascular dynamics legible to modern clinicians.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>For pathologic JVD in actual patients, management targets the cause: diuretics, ACE inhibitors/ARNI, and beta-blockers for heart failure; valve repair or replacement for severe tricuspid lesions; pericardiocentesis for tamponade; oxygenation and decompression for tension pneumothorax; and sustained hypertension control via lifestyle and pharmacotherapy. Bedside assessment includes jugular venous pressure estimation with the patient at 30–45 degrees. The sculpture’s scenario represents physiologic, not therapeutic, venous distension.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Cardiovascular risk is shaped by diet, stress, environmental exposures, and access to care. Renaissance Florentines experienced class-based disparities in nutrition and medical attention; today, income, education, housing stability, and neighborhood resources continue to pattern hypertension and heart failure prevalence. Public monuments like David project civic ideals, but they can obscure the unequal conditions that foster disease. Contemporary conservation campaigns, meanwhile, highlight how social investment protects cultural icons far more reliably than vulnerable human bodies.</p>
