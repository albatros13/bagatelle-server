        <h1>Francisco Goya, Beggars Who Get about on Their Own in Bordeaux (c. 1824–1827)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Francisco de Goya y Lucientes (1746–1828) was a Spanish painter and printmaker whose late works transformed European visual culture. Having served as a court painter, he increasingly turned toward private, probing observations of everyday life, injustice, and bodily vulnerability. This drawing belongs to his late Bordeaux years, when, in self-imposed exile in France, Goya filled albums with rapid studies of street life, disability, aging, and social marginality.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in Bordeaux after 1824, the work reflects post-Napoleonic Europe, marked by political reaction, mass displacement, and widespread poverty. Spain’s liberal-conservative turmoil and Goya’s exile provide the backdrop, while France grappled with urban migration and changing regimes. The rise of philanthropic societies coexisted with punitive vagrancy laws, shaping how disabled poor navigated city streets. Goya’s sketchbooks from this period capture these tensions with a documentary immediacy that anticipates modern social realism.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The hand-propelled cart and the sitter’s grounded posture signify resourcefulness amid deprivation. Wheels become a cipher of precarious autonomy: mobility is possible, but only within a system that withholds full inclusion. The worn hat and thick beard denote the codes of street survival, while the intimate scale of the drawing suggests a witness-like proximity. Rather than allegory, Goya uses quotidian objects to encode structural realities—poverty, disability, and the negotiation of public space.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Executed with brisk graphite or ink lines, the sheet epitomizes Goya’s late economy of means: spare contour, localized hatching for volume, and an unadorned background that projects the figure forward. The wheel’s crisp ellipse anchors the composition, a geometric counterpoint to the organic, frayed textures of clothing and hair. Rhythmic line clusters model mass without heavy chiaroscuro, while asymmetry and off-center placement create dynamism and the sensation of halted motion—an instant caught mid-journey.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The subject embodies layered inequities: disability, poverty, and the stigma of begging in a moralizing public sphere. In nineteenth-century France and Spain, institutional care was inconsistent and local relief often conditional. Disabled veterans and laborers injured by war or industry frequently lacked formal support; relief networks favored deservingness narratives, leaving many to self-propel through city economies of alms. Goya’s sympathetic but unsentimental gaze exposes these asymmetries without resorting to caricature.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While no diagnosis is explicit, the image implies lower-limb impairment necessitating a small wheeled conveyance. Plausible etiologies in the 1820s include traumatic injury (common after decades of warfare and manual labor), sequelae of poliomyelitis (acute flaccid paralysis), spinal tuberculosis (Pott disease causing paraplegia), advanced congenital deformities, or complications of untreated infections leading to amputation. Vascular disease and diabetic neuropathy were less frequently recognized at the time but could also contribute in older adults.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Visual cues include the subject’s seated ground-level posture, reliance on arm strength, and the compact cart replacing ambulatory function—signs consistent with severe lower-limb weakness, contracture, or limb loss. The bundled clothing around the legs may suggest atrophy or concealment of amputation stumps. The forward lean and firm grip on the wheel rim indicate compensatory strategies typical in paraplegia or post-amputation mobility, aligning with period descriptions of “invalid carriages.”</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Contemporary treatments were limited. Traumatic injuries often culminated in amputation, with rudimentary prostheses and hand-propelled carts for mobility. Spinal tuberculosis management relied on prolonged rest, bracing, and supportive care; effective antimicrobial therapy would not arrive until the mid-twentieth century. Poliomyelitis care was largely supportive—splinting, massage, and later physiotherapy. For syphilis-related neuropathies, mercury and, later, iodide therapies were used with mixed efficacy and significant toxicity. Early wheelchairs and low carts—visible here—functioned as practical prosthetic technologies, enabling economic and social participation albeit within constrained public infrastructures.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Urban poverty, inadequate sanitation, and crowding elevated infectious disease risks. Irregular employment and hazardous labor increased trauma and exposure to disabling injury. Access to care depended on charity, guilds, or military pensions; migrants and exiles—precisely the communities Goya observed—often fell outside local safety nets. Stigma toward visible disability shaped where and how one could move or earn, making the street both livelihood and site of surveillance. The drawing crystallizes how illness outcomes were inseparable from policy, class, and urban design.</p>
