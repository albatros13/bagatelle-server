        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The upper panel is by Richard Tennant Cooper, a British painter working for Henry Wellcome in the early twentieth century. Cooper created striking allegories in which infectious diseases appear as supernatural presences intruding on domestic life. The lower panel is by Giovanni Gerolamo Savoldo, a Lombard master active in Venice and Brescia in the early sixteenth century. Savoldo’s Temptation (or Torment) of Saint Anthony belongs to a long tradition of depicting the desert hermit beset by demonic forces; here, the visual rhetoric also invokes the burning skin disorders historically associated with “Saint Anthony’s Fire.”</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Cooper’s 1912 image emerges from an Edwardian moment when germ theory was firmly established and public health campaigns sought to control sexually transmitted infections. New laboratory sciences, public clinics, and the recent introduction of arsphenamine (Salvarsan, 1909–1910) shaped hopes for biomedical conquest even as moral stigma persisted. Savoldo painted around 1515, amid Renaissance humanism and urban prosperity in northern Italy but also recurrent epidemics and skin afflictions. “St. Anthony’s Fire” circulated in popular consciousness to name excruciating burning diseases—most accurately ergotism from contaminated rye, yet at times conflated with erysipelas. Monastic Antonine hospitals specialized in caring for sufferers, and the saint’s iconography promised spiritual and bodily relief.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>Cooper personifies syphilis as a translucent, seductive spirit whose diaphanous veil curls like pathogen-laden miasma. The listing posture of the seated man, drooping flowers, and nocturnal interior signal shame, fatigue, and social isolation; a childlike spectral visage accompanying the figure can be read as a warning of congenital transmission. Savoldo sets St. Anthony before jagged rocks while fires rage in the distance; tiny grotesques creep from crevices, visualizing invasive pain. The landscape’s pathways and river allude to spiritual journeys, while the flaming sky encodes the burning, sharply demarcated erythema characteristic of erysipelas and the searing sensations of “fire” reported in both erysipelas and ergotism.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Cooper combines late Symbolist dramaturgy with Art Nouveau line. The sinuous arabesque of the veil and the toxic greens against warm interior reds create chromatic dissonance that “poisons” the scene. Strong chiaroscuro isolates the sufferer, using emphasis and contrast to stage a moral-psychological drama. Savoldo employs Venetian glazing and atmospheric perspective: cool distant blues recede, while warm earth tones model Anthony’s drapery with sculptural gravity. The composition balances calm foreground piety against turbulent background catastrophe, a Renaissance equilibrium destabilized by infernal diagonals.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Cooper’s subject reflects how venereal disease prosecutes inequities: women—especially sex workers—were policed more harshly than men, and working-class patients had limited access to confidential care. Colonial militaries and urban poverty amplified transmission. In Savoldo’s era, rural peasants who relied on rye were most vulnerable to ergotism; crowded, poor households likewise faced erysipelas through skin breaks and inadequate sanitation. Art thus records disease as socially distributed rather than merely biological.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, acquired through sexual contact or vertically during pregnancy. Following a painless chancre, untreated infection may progress to secondary rash and systemic involvement, then latent phases, and, in some cases, tertiary disease affecting cardiovascular and nervous systems. Congenital infection risks stillbirth or multisystem morbidity. Erysipelas is an acute superficial bacterial infection of the upper dermis and lymphatics, most commonly due to Streptococcus pyogenes. It often enters through minor skin trauma, tinea pedis, or ulcers, producing an abrupt febrile illness.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinically, syphilis presents with a chancre at the inoculation site, followed by disseminated maculopapular rash (notably on palms and soles), mucous patches, “moth-eaten” alopecia, and, later, gummatous lesions or neurosyphilis. Cooper’s ghostly companion externalizes these invisible pathogens while the despondent figure signals neuropsychiatric dread and stigma; the evocation of a child hints at congenital outcomes. Erysipelas features a bright-red, raised, sharply demarcated plaque, local warmth, edema, tenderness, and lymphangitic streaking, with a burning sensation that aligns with the fiery landscape in Savoldo’s panel.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Historically, Cooper’s audience knew of arsphenamine as the first effective antisyphilitic; today, benzathine penicillin G remains first-line therapy, with doxycycline alternatives for non-pregnant penicillin-allergic patients and penicillin desensitization in pregnancy. For erysipelas, penicillin is the mainstay (phenoxymethylpenicillin or amoxicillin; intravenous therapy for severe cases). Addressing portals of entry, edema control, and skin care helps prevent recurrences.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Poverty, housing instability, incarceration, and limited sexual health services increase syphilis risk and impede partner notification and prenatal screening. For erysipelas, chronic lymphedema, diabetes, homelessness, inadequate footwear, and poor access to hygiene facilities predispose to infection and relapse. Education, harm reduction, and equitable primary care transform the social ecology in which these pathogens circulate.</p>
