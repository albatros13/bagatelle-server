        <h2>Michelangelo Ecorche Leg (1)</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564), the Italian High Renaissance master, is celebrated primarily as a sculptor and painter but also as a rigorous student of anatomy. Accounts describe his access to bodies for dissection at the Hospital of Santo Spirito in Florence, experiences that informed his sculptural sense of the body’s structural logic. In this ecorché study of the leg rendered in red chalk, Michelangelo isolates the muscular envelope—gastrocnemius, soleus, hamstrings, and peroneal groups—to investigate how power, balance, and movement are constructed from layered tissues rather than surface appearance.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>Produced in the early sixteenth century, the drawing emerges from a moment when humanist inquiry and empirical observation reshaped European knowledge. Artists and physicians alike challenged received authorities by going to the body itself. Although formal anatomical theaters flourished slightly later with Vesalius’s De humani corporis fabrica (1543), Michelangelo’s generation already treated dissection and studio studies as complementary. In papal Rome and republican Florence, the athletic, idealized male body was the civic and spiritual measure of excellence; anatomy served both art and theology by revealing the body as an instrument of divine proportion and human agency.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>An ecorché is both literal and emblematic: the flayed figure signifies veritas—truth laid bare. The leg, engine of stride and contrapposto, symbolizes motion, will, and heroic action. Red chalk (sanguigna) evokes blood and vitality while permitting subtle modulation of tendon versus muscle bellies. The dual views—medial and posterior—function like an anatomical icon: not a portrait, but an archetype of the leg’s mechanics. By abstracting skin, the sheet strips identity to foreground structure, aligning the body with a canon of ideal form and with the workshop’s didactic needs.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>Michelangelo employs crisp contour, directional hatching, and carefully weighted line to model volume without tonal wash. The rhythmic alternation of convex and concave forms—hamstring tendons flanking the popliteal fossa, the bulge of gastrocnemius heads tapering into the Achilles tendon—creates a cadence of tension and release. Proportion is stabilized by an implied axis, while slight torsion suggests readiness for movement. Negative space clarifies compartment boundaries, anticipating the sculptor’s subtractive logic. Didactically, the sheet maps how forces transmit from thigh to calf to calcaneus, a visual primer in biomechanics.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Renaissance anatomical knowledge depended on uneven access to corpses—often the bodies of the poor, marginalized, or executed. Such asymmetries underwrote elite artistic training while the subjects themselves remained voiceless. Gatekeeping within workshops limited who could study from the nude or attend dissections, reinforcing gendered and class hierarchies. These dynamics echo today in differential access to health education and imaging technologies, reminding viewers that anatomical “truths” are produced within social structures that distribute both risk and learning unequally.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>As a biomedical lens on this leg, peripheral artery disease (PAD) is instructive. PAD results from atherosclerotic narrowing of lower-extremity arteries—typically the superficial femoral, popliteal, tibial, or peroneal vessels—leading to reduced perfusion of muscles like the gastrocnemius and soleus during exertion. Endothelial injury from smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia drives intimal inflammation, lipid deposition, and plaque formation. Progressive stenosis compromises oxygen delivery, causing ischemic pain with walking (intermittent claudication). Microvascular rarefaction and impaired nitric oxide signaling exacerbate exercise intolerance and tissue vulnerability.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Clinically, PAD presents with exertional calf pain, diminished dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses, cool skin, delayed capillary refill, hair loss, and, in advanced cases, ulceration along pressure points of the foot. The muscles depicted—particularly the gastrocnemius—are classic pain sites when the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries are diseased. Over time, disuse and ischemia yield muscle atrophy, subtly altering the contours that Michelangelo so carefully maps. Objective markers include an ankle–brachial index less than 0.90, duplex ultrasonography showing flow reduction, and imaging (CTA/MRA) identifying segmental stenoses.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Management begins with risk-factor modification: smoking cessation, statin therapy, blood pressure and glycemic control, and antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin or clopidogrel). Supervised exercise therapy improves collateralization and walking distance, while cilostazol can reduce claudication in selected patients. For lifestyle-limiting symptoms or limb-threatening ischemia, revascularization—endovascular angioplasty with or without stenting, atherectomy, or surgical bypass—restores flow to affected calf and foot compartments. Wound care, protective footwear, and infection control are crucial when ulcers occur. The drawing’s anatomical clarity—tracking tendons, compartments, and neurovascular paths—mirrors the precision required for safe vascular access and graft routing.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>PAD disproportionately affects communities with lower income, limited access to primary care, and higher burdens of smoking and diabetes. Neighborhood walkability, food environments, and occupational exposures shape risk and the feasibility of exercise therapy. Structural racism correlates with delayed diagnosis and higher amputation rates despite similar disease severity. Health literacy, insurance coverage, and transportation all mediate timely screening, pulse examination, and referral for vascular evaluation—determinants as consequential as any plaque morphology.</p>
