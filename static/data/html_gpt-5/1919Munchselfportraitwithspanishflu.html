        <h1>Munch self portrait with spanish flu (1919)</h1>

        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
        The work is by Edvard Munch, a Norwegian painter associated with Symbolism and a founding voice of Northern European Expressionism. His career was devoted to visualizing psychological states—an interest that, in this canvas, intersects with the literal physiology of illness. Here, the artist channels Expressionist means to examine the lived experience of influenza during a global pandemic.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
        Painted in 1919, the picture belongs to the immediate aftermath of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic, contemporaneous with post–World War I dislocation. Norway escaped combat but not the virus; civic life, labor patterns, and domestic spaces were reorganized around contagion and convalescence. The painting’s stripped interior, empty bed, and solitary figure situate it within a time when home became clinic, and the private sphere bore the weight of public health crisis.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
        The stark bed functions as a proxy for the sickroom, while the blanket pooled over the sitter’s lap suggests fever management and the rhythms of rest. A slim, upright candle near the bed reads as a vanitas sign—life’s flame precariously sustained—echoing Northern European traditions of memento mori. Acidic oranges and sickly greens connote feverish heat and nausea; the diagonal vacancy between figure and bed embodies absence, the space of lost vitality. The chair’s tenuous angle intimates bodily instability and the threat of collapse.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
        Munch’s Expressionist palette subordinates naturalism to affect: cadmium oranges and viridian greens clash to exteriorize fever and hypoxia. Rapid, scumbled brushwork generates a tactile surface that mirrors labored breath; paint seems to thin and thicken like symptoms waxing and waning. Compositionally, the figure is pressed to the picture’s edge, ceding a wide, near-abstract field that intensifies isolation. Line is elastic and tremulous, contouring the sitter with wavering strokes that undermine corporeal certainty. The result is a synthesis of Symbolism’s emblematic objects and Expressionism’s agitated facture.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
        The 1918–1919 pandemic amplified inequities along class, occupation, and colonial lines. Overcrowded housing, industrial worksites, and military barracks increased exposure; poorer communities had limited access to physicians, clean air, and rest. Censorship in wartime nations impeded timely public health messaging. Indigenous and colonized populations suffered disproportionately high mortality, revealing how structural vulnerability, not simply viral virulence, patterned outcomes—realities this interior’s austerity and solitude obliquely acknowledge.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
        The so-called “Spanish flu” was caused by an influenza A (H1N1) virus, with genomic evidence pointing to an avian origin. Transmission occurred via respiratory droplets and aerosols, with short incubation and high secondary attack rates. Mortality peaked unusually among young adults, likely from dysregulated immune responses (cytokine storm) and secondary bacterial pneumonias. The virus’s rapid global spread was abetted by troop movements and dense urban networks.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
        The painting encodes clinical signs through visual analogues: the pallid, slack face signals malaise and dehydration; the hunched posture and blanketed legs suggest myalgia and chills alternating with fever; the vacant bed intimates nocturnal restlessness. Color zones operate like symptom maps—orange heat fields for fever, greenish tones for nausea and respiratory compromise. The thin candle evokes shallow, tenuous respiration, while the compressed spatial depth mimics the air hunger of pneumonic involvement.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment<br>
        In 1918–1919, care was largely supportive: isolation, fresh air, hydration, nutrition, and nursing. Oxygen therapy was rudimentary; antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections did not exist, and excessive aspirin dosing, documented in some settings, may have worsened outcomes. Contemporary management of severe influenza includes vaccination for prevention, neuraminidase inhibitors (for early cases), respiratory support, and antibiotics for bacterial superinfection—advances that underscore how biomedical infrastructures shape mortality curves.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
        Crowding, occupational exposure, malnutrition, and limited healthcare access heightened risk and severity. Information inequities—delayed warnings, rumor, and stigma—compromised compliance with nonpharmaceutical interventions. Gendered caregiving labor concentrated exposure among nurses and household carers. Environmental factors such as poor ventilation further magnified transmission. The work’s domestic clinic—chair, bed, blanket, candle—renders these determinants palpable, showing illness as a social condition inscribed in space.</p>
