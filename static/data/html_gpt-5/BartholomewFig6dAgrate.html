        <h1>Bartholomew Agrate (6)</h1>
        <p>File: BartholomewFig6dAgrate.jpg</p>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The sculpture is by Marco d’Agrate, a Lombard sculptor active in mid-sixteenth-century Milan. Trained within the orbit of the Duomo’s large architectural and sculptural workshop, d’Agrate combined late Renaissance naturalism with a pronounced Mannerist taste for virtuosic display. His statue of Saint Bartholomew—rendered as a flayed man who wears his own skin as a mantle—bears the proud inscription “Non me Praxiteles, sed Marcus finxit Agrates,” asserting the author’s identity while invoking classical lineage.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>Dated 1562 and installed in Milan Cathedral, the work emerges at the crest of the Catholic Reform, when images of martyrs served as intense confessional propaganda. In the same decades, anatomical science was reshaped by Vesalius’s De humani corporis fabrica (1543). Northern Italian courts and cities cultivated collaboration between artists and surgeons; legal, religious, and civic authorities oversaw dissections. The statue thus occupies a nexus where Counter-Reformation piety met empirical inquiry, translating a saint’s legend into an écorché-like demonstration of human anatomy.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
        <p>Bartholomew, one of the Twelve Apostles, was traditionally martyred by flaying. Here, the saint’s removed integument is draped over his shoulders as if it were a robe, a shocking yet devotional sign of steadfast faith. The book in his hand recalls his evangelizing mission. The skin-as-drapery functions doubly: a literal emblem of martyrdom and a sculptural conceit equating sacred suffering with the artist’s mastery over stone and flesh. The exposed musculature evokes the truth of the Incarnation: a body subject to pain yet transfigured in sanctity.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>The figure stands in a controlled contrapposto; rhythms of obliques, rectus abdominis, and sartorius create diagonals that animate the surface. D’Agrate models fascia, tendinous inscriptions, and muscle bellies with crisp chiaroscuro, allowing light to rake across striations like a drawn anatomical plate in three dimensions. The “drapery” of the flayed skin replays Classical folds while emphasizing material paradox. Proportion is idealized but not heroic; the head is slightly small, intensifying the body’s didactic legibility. The overall effect is Mannerist: elegant, unsettling, and technically dazzling.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The Renaissance anatomy theater relied on unequal access to bodies—often those of executed criminals or the poor—creating asymmetries between scientific authority and marginalized people. Martyr imagery likewise narrates violence enacted by imperial power. This sculpture, celebrated for knowledge and faith, is built upon historical regimes where control over bodies—legal, medical, and theological—was unevenly distributed.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Medically, the depicted condition corresponds to total-body degloving or full-thickness skin avulsion, an extreme traumatic injury. Etiology in the legend is deliberate torture using sharp dissection. Pathophysiologically, loss of the integument disrupts hemostasis and thermoregulation, eliminates the barrier against pathogens, and triggers massive fluid shifts leading to hypovolemic/hemorrhagic shock. The absence of skin also abolishes cutaneous sensory protection, exposing peripheral nerves and causing excruciating pain.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The statue presents hallmark features of an écorché: visible sternocleidomastoid, pectoralis major, serratus anterior slips, the six-pack inscriptions of rectus abdominis, tensor fasciae latae, sartorius crossing the thigh, and gastrocnemius-soleus masses in the calf. The veins of the skin are absent, correctly implying their removal with the integument; tendons at the wrist and ankle read as taut cords. The draped “skin” includes facial features and hair, iconographically precise to the hagiography. Anatomical accuracy suggests familiarity with contemporary dissection and plates derived from Vesalius.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>In a modern setting, management would follow Advanced Trauma Life Support: airway and breathing secured, rapid control of hemorrhage, warmed isotonic resuscitation balanced with blood products, and early broad-spectrum antibiotics. Wound care would emphasize meticulous debridement, negative-pressure therapy when feasible, and staged coverage with autografts, allografts, or dermal substitutes; major areas would require microsurgical free-flap reconstruction. Analgesia, tetanus prophylaxis, and vigilant sepsis prevention are essential. Historically, such an injury was unsurvivable; the saint’s intact posture underscores the miracle beyond medical plausibility.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Bartholomew’s fate is anchored in religious persecution—an extreme determinant of violence-related morbidity. More broadly, access to trauma surgery, blood products, and antisepsis remains stratified by geography and wealth. The Renaissance circulation of anatomical knowledge privileged Latin-literate elites, while today disparities persist in burn and trauma outcomes along lines of income, conflict exposure, and hospital proximity. The sculpture invites reflection on how power structures shape who is harmed, who is healed, and whose bodies become sites of knowledge.</p>
