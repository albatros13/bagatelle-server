        <h1>Ayurvedic Man Anatomical Figure (1700s)</h1>
        <p><em>Caption: ayurvedic man anatomical figure 1700s</em></p>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The image belongs to the wider tradition of South Asian medical illustration associated with Ayurvedic scholarship and workshop practices active in North India and the Himalayan region. These charts were often made by artisan-painters working for physicians (vaidya) or for learned households, rather than by named, individual artists. Their makers combined courtly manuscript techniques—ink outlines, mineral and vegetable pigments on paper—with the didactic aims of medical pedagogy.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        Dating to the 17th–18th centuries, the figure reflects early modern South Asia, when Sanskrit, Persian, and vernacular medical knowledge interacted dynamically. Ayurveda’s classical textual base (Caraka, Suśruta, Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya) was transmitted alongside practical compendia and household formularies. Mughal and post-Mughal courts fostered cosmopolitan exchanges among Ayurveda, Unani (Greco-Islamic medicine), and Tibetan therapeutics. Portable didactic charts like this served as mnemonic and diagnostic tools in clinics and teaching lineages, bridging textual learning and embodied practice.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The body is rendered frontally, with inscribed passages flanking the figure. Organs and vessels are stylized as emblematic nodes and channels, mapping concepts such as srotas (physiological conduits), agni (metabolic fire), and the three doṣas—vāta, pitta, kapha—often indicated by color or emblematic forms. Circular medallions within the torso may signify key organs or receptacles (āśayas), while cranial and abdominal centers sometimes allude to marmas (vulnerable sites) and cakra-like nodalities. The diagram is not a literal dissectional atlas; rather, it encodes a functional body where flows, heats, and winds structure vitality.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        Line is paramount: a firm contour stabilizes the silhouette, while finer linear networks articulate channels and inscriptions. Limited but high-contrast pigments mark physiologically salient zones, guiding the viewer’s attention hierarchically. The planar, frontal pose and lack of perspectival recession reinforce legibility, consistent with manuscript marginalia and yantra diagrams. Text-image interdependence—script bands framing the figure—signals a didactic aesthetic, where reading and seeing occur simultaneously.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Access to learned medicine in early modern South Asia was stratified by caste, gender, literacy, and patronage. Elite households secured consultation and manuscript production, while rural communities often relied on oral knowledge and midwifery. Women’s health knowledge circulated in domestic spheres but was underrepresented in formal treatises. Under colonial rule, institutional privileging of biomedicine and print-centric epistemologies further marginalized artisanal medical illustration and non-elite practitioners, narrowing who could claim authoritative expertise.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        Within Ayurvedic theory, disease arises when doṣic equilibria—vāta (motion), pitta (transformation/heat), kapha (cohesion)—are disturbed by diet, season, habits, emotions, or environmental exposures. Impaired agni generates āma (metabolic residue), which obstructs srotas and inflames tissues (dhātu). Etiology is thus relational: constitution (prakṛti) modulates susceptibility, while time (kāla) and place (deśa) shape risk. The chart’s emphasis on conduits and nodal points visualizes how obstruction, dryness, overheating, or dampness might manifest systemically.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Visual cues—darkened channels, emphasized abdominal cavities, and highlighted cranial centers—index symptom clusters described in texts: altered appetite, disturbed sleep, bowel irregularity, dizziness, and pain patterns traceable along pathways. Marmas denote critical junctions where injury precipitates systemic collapse. The head-to-gut axis underscores diagnostic priorities of tongue, pulse, stool, and urine—surrogates for internal states. While organs appear, their shapes are schematic, subordinated to functional relations among heat, flow, and accumulation.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Treatment aligns with the logic of clearing, cooling, warming, lubricating, or stabilizing according to the deranged doṣa. Classical regimens integrate ahāra (dietetics), vihāra (daily and seasonal routines), aushadha (herbal/mineral formulations), and śodhana (elimination therapies, including pañcakarma) to restore flow and rekindle agni. Surgical knowledge (e.g., rhinoplasty and wound care) preserved in the Suśruta tradition complements internal medicine. The chart functioned pedagogically, guiding selection of routes—gastrointestinal, dermal, nasal—through which interventions influence systemic networks.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        The etiological emphasis on place, season, labor, and diet resonates with modern social determinants: climate stress, food insecurity, occupational exposures, and crowding shape morbidity. In early modern South Asia, famine cycles, urban sanitation, and caste-based labor stratification patterned disease burdens. The figure’s universalized body, stripped of markers of class or gender, paradoxically highlights the ideal of a shared human physiology while masking structural inequities that conditioned who fell ill and who received care.
