        <h1>Votive Stele of Mother Fainting After Childbirth (Classical Greek, late 5th century BCE)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The relief is attributed to an unknown Attic sculptor working in a Classical Greek workshop. As with many small votive offerings, authorship was less important than function: the object served as a dedication, likely to a healing or childbirth divinity such as Eileithyia or Artemis. The refined carving suggests a trained urban atelier conversant with the canons of the late Classical style.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Produced in the late 5th century BCE, probably in Athens or another Attic center, the stele belongs to a period marked by civic upheaval and innovation in cult practice. Sanctuaries of Eileithyia and the expanding cult of Asklepios attracted supplicants seeking divine aid for reproductive and pediatric crises. Dedications commemorated danger survived or solicited protection. High maternal and infant mortality shaped women’s ritual lives; female networks of kin and midwives intersected with public sanctuaries where families displayed piety through reliefs such as this.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The composition shows a seated woman collapsing after delivery, supported by an attendant, while a larger, authoritative female figure approaches, identifiable as a goddess by her scale and staff or scepter. In Greek iconography, the epiphany of a deity in relief signals divine oversight. The fainting mother encodes the moment of postpartum peril; the attendant’s touch visualizes midwifery care. The stool and draped garments denote domestic space, while the goddess’s vertical stance introduces the sacred realm. Such votives publicly record both vulnerability and gratitude, linking bodily crisis to cultic intervention.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The low relief relies on rhythmic drapery to articulate anatomy, a hallmark of the “wet drapery” manner. Contrasting verticals (goddess and staff) with diagonals (the mother’s slumping torso) organize the field and dramatize collapse. Subtle overlapping establishes shallow spatial depth; the quiet faces convey restraint typical of Classical decorum. Tool marks on the background plane and delicate undercutting at garment hems reveal practiced stoneworking that achieves nuance within modest scale.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Childbirth in Classical Greece was stratified by status. Elite households could summon experienced midwives and sponsor dedications; enslaved women and the poor faced greater risk with fewer ritual and medical resources. Male-authored medical texts mediated women’s experiences, often normalizing suffering while minimizing female agency. A votive like this may have been funded by a household patriarch, turning a woman’s crisis into a monument that also advertised family piety. Access to sanctuaries, literacy for inscriptions, and the cost of marble all index unequal participation in healing cults.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The scene is widely read as postpartum syncope. Modern differential diagnosis includes postpartum hemorrhage, vasovagal fainting after exertion, eclampsia-related complications, sepsis, or severe anemia. Ancient explanations appeared in humoral terms: depletion of vital heat and blood during labor, retention or excess of lochia, and obstruction of the womb. Hippocratic treatises describe collapse, chills, and pallor after delivery, attributed to imbalance or “wandering” of the womb, concepts that structured therapy and ritual recourse.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Visual indicators of illness include the mother’s limp arm, bowed head, and reliance on support—canonical signs of weakness in Classical art. The seated posture suggests acute post-event exhaustion rather than active labor. The attentive attendant functions as an iconographic marker of caregiving, while the goddess signifies recourse beyond human skill, implying that the episode was life-threatening by contemporary standards.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Ancient management combined midwifery techniques with ritual. Texts advise uterine massage, pressure and bandaging of the abdomen, warm compresses, aromatics to revive consciousness, uterine pessaries, and herbal astringents for bleeding. Offerings to Eileithyia or Artemis sought divine aid, and later Asklepian incubation promised dreams prescribing remedies. From a modern perspective, the likely evidence-based care for hemorrhage would include active management of the third stage of labor, oxytocin, uterine massage, tranexamic acid, IV fluids and blood products; for eclampsia, magnesium sulfate and blood pressure control; for infection, timely antibiotics and source control.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Nutritional status (notably iron intake), parity, age at first birth, sanitation, and the availability of skilled attendants strongly influenced outcomes. Mobility restrictions on women, household economics, and distance to sanctuaries or healers shaped both care and votive practice. The relief crystallizes a network of determinants—gendered labor, class, ritual infrastructure—that mediated who survived childbirth and whose stories were materialized in stone.</p>
