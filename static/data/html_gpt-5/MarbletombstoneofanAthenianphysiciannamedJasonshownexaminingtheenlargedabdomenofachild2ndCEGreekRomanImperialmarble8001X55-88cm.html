<h1>Marble tombstone of an Athenian physician named Jason</h1>
<p><em>Relief showing a doctor palpating a child’s distended abdomen, Roman Imperial period, 2nd century CE.</em></p>

<h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
<p>The stele is the product of an Attic funerary workshop, carved by an anonymous sculptor active in Roman-period Athens. The inscription names the deceased as Jason, identified as an iatros (physician). While the individual hand is unknown, the work reflects the collaborative craft traditions of Greek stonecarving, where letter cutters and relief sculptors often worked in tandem. The subject matter aligns the deceased with a professional guild of healers who traced their lineage to Hippocratic practice and, culturally, to the cult of Asklepios.</p>

<h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
<p>Dating to the 2nd century CE, the relief belongs to the Roman Imperial era when Athens enjoyed renewed prestige as a center of paideia and philosophical education. Funerary stelai remained a preferred commemorative form, combining portraiture with scenes that advertised virtues and professions. Medicine in this period was plural: bedside Hippocratic rationalism coexisted with temple incubation at Asklepieia, folk remedies, and itinerant specialists. Physicians operated in an urban environment marked by crowded housing, variable sanitation, and periodic epidemics—conditions that shaped both disease prevalence and medical iconography.</p>

<h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
<p>The seated figure in physician’s mantle extends his right hand to palpate the child’s abdomen, a canonical gesture of clinical examination that signals diagnostic authority. The naked child, with attenuated limbs and a protuberant belly, functions simultaneously as patient and emblem of the physician’s charity. At right sits a rounded vessel—interpreted variously as a cupping jar, urinal, or container for instruments—signifying the material culture of practice. The inscription below anchors identity while the high, altar-like crowning echoes sepulchral architecture, elevating the healing vocation to a civic virtue worthy of memory.</p>

<h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
<p>The low relief employs shallow modeling and oblique drapery folds characteristic of late Attic workshops, creating a quiet, intimate tableau. Compositionally, a diagonal runs from the physician’s gaze through his arm to the child’s abdomen, concentrating visual energy at the diagnostic touchpoint. The simplified background suppresses depth to foreground interpersonal exchange. Proportional contrast—massive seated adult versus slight child—intensifies empathy while the blocky letterforms of the inscription provide a rhythmic base, unifying text and image.</p>

<h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
<p>The scene hints at unequal access to care. Physicians in Roman Greece ranged from elite, literate practitioners to enslaved or freed specialists; patients’ outcomes often mirrored status. Children, the poor, migrants, and enslaved people suffered disproportionate morbidity from malnutrition and parasites. Commemorating a physician in stone celebrates civic benefaction, yet also marks class: only households with resources commissioned such stelai. The child’s nudity signals vulnerability and, perhaps, the anonymity of the urban poor who formed a large share of medical caseloads but rarely left self-authored monuments.</p>

<h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
<p>The child’s markedly enlarged abdomen contrasted with thin extremities suggests the anciently described hydrops (dropsy), broadly encompassing ascites. Differential diagnoses include hepatic disease with portal hypertension (viral hepatitis or alcohol is unlikely in a child, but congenital or infectious hepatitis and Wilson disease are possibilities), severe protein-energy malnutrition (kwashiorkor), nephrotic syndrome, or intestinal helminthiasis (notably ascariasis), which can produce a “pot-belly” through intestinal load and malnutrition. In Greek medical texts, fluid accumulation in the belly was framed as dyscrasia—an imbalance of humors—often tied to diet, environment, and impaired organ function.</p>

<h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
<p>Visual markers include abdominal distension, probable protrusion at the umbilicus, rib visibility, and diminished muscle bulk of limbs. The physician’s hand placed low across the abdomen evokes percussion or eliciting a fluid wave, procedures described in Hippocratic writings. The child’s forward lean may intimate dyspnea associated with massive ascites. Absence of edema in the legs is not legible in relief, reminding us that iconographic compression simplifies complex symptom clusters.</p>

<h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
<p>Ancient therapeutics would begin with regimen—barley-based diets, controlled fluids, and rest—followed by pharmaka such as hellebore purges or diuretics. Cupping and phlebotomy sought to rebalance humors; for refractory ascites, texts describe paracentesis-like puncture and drainage with cautery. If helminths were suspected, purgatives and botanical anthelmintics were administered. Modern management would prioritize etiology: albendazole for ascariasis; nutritional rehabilitation for kwashiorkor; salt restriction, spironolactone/furosemide, and therapeutic paracentesis for portal hypertensive ascites; and disease-specific therapy for hepatic or renal causes.</p>

<h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
<p>Urban crowding, inadequate sanitation, and contaminated water facilitated enteric parasites; periodic food shortages exacerbated child malnutrition. Household status mediated exposure and recovery: secure access to grain, clean wells, and physician services reduced risk. Cultural norms around weaning and child feeding, as well as labor demands on mothers, further shaped pediatric vulnerability. The stele thus documents not only a medical act but a public health landscape in which poverty, housing, and environment were decisive co-authors of disease.</p>
