<h1>Depiction of Scotomas (1870)</h1>
<p>Caption: Depiction of scotomas — Hubert Airy, On a distinct form of Transient Hemiopsia, Royal Society of London (1870)</p>

<h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
<p>Hubert Airy was a nineteenth-century British physician whose keen self-observation of migraine auras made him a pioneering figure in neuro-ophthalmology. Trained in medicine yet embedded in a milieu that prized precise scientific drawing, Airy transformed personal episodes of visual disturbance into analytical images. His plate of “scintillating scotoma” is both document and visualization: a patient-physician’s record, drafted to communicate subjective vision with objective clarity. Though not an artist by profession, Airy’s disciplined draftsmanship and sensitivity to perceptual nuance place this work firmly within the history of scientific illustration as an artistic practice.</p>

<h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
<p>Produced in 1870 in Victorian Britain, the image belongs to a period of rapid advances in physiology, ophthalmology, and neurology. This was the era when systematic self-experimentation and precise diagramming became valued tools of investigation. The emergent clinic and laboratory sought to quantify sensation; lithographic and chromolithographic printing enabled the reproduction of complex perceptual data. Urbanization, gas and early electric lighting, and long industrial workdays heightened interest in headaches and visual strain. Airy’s paper to the Royal Society—framed around “transient hemiopsia”—helped shift migraine from moral and temperamental explanations toward neurophysiological mechanisms grounded in cortical function.</p>

<h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
<p>The plate’s jagged, crenellated zigzags—often called “fortification spectra”—evoke the geometry of city ramparts, metaphorically linking the aura’s advancing edge to a fortified wall. Concentric prismatic fringes suggest scintillation, a shimmer of light that patients report as colored, flashing, or crystalline. The black ground functions as the visual field, within which islands and arcs of negative space represent blind or dim regions (scotomata). As an iconographic program, the sheet codifies the aura’s temporality: small figures mark initial points, larger forms chart expansion and migration through the field, converting an experience in time into a spatial sequence.</p>

<h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
<p>Airy exploits high-contrast figure–ground relationships: pale, serrated lines leap from a dark field, articulating edge detection—the very function the aura disrupts. The repeated zigzag produces rhythm, while the arc’s curvature implies movement across the retina’s mapped cortex. Slight chromatic offsets along the edges read as dispersion, a graphic analogue to scintillation. Balance is asymmetrical; the eye tracks from scattered motifs to a dominant arc, mirroring the clinical evolution from small paracentral flickers to a sweeping hemifield phenomenon. Precision of line, economy of color, and seriality align the plate with contemporary scientific graphics and early data visualization.</p>

<h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
<p>Historically, migraine—especially in women—was dismissed as hysteria or fragility, leading to underdiagnosis and inadequate care. Industrial laborers had limited access to specialists, while elite observers like Airy enjoyed platforms to publish. Today, migraine remains a leading cause of disability worldwide, yet disparities persist: women, people with lower income, and racialized groups frequently encounter barriers to diagnosis, advanced therapies, and workplace accommodations. The image, produced within a learned society, thus also reflects the inequitable infrastructures that have historically mediated whose symptoms were recorded, believed, and canonized.</p>

<h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
<p>Airy’s subject is migraine with visual aura, here manifesting as transient hemianopic scotomas and scintillating zigzags. Contemporary science attributes aura to cortical spreading depression (CSD)—a slowly propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarization followed by suppression, typically originating in occipital cortex. CSD perturbs ionic gradients, blood flow, and neurovascular coupling, producing transient visual dysfunction mapped retinotopically across V1. Downstream activation of the trigeminovascular system can trigger headache pain; genetic susceptibility (e.g., ion channel variants such as CACNA1A in some familial forms) modulates risk. Environmental triggers—sleep disruption, stress, light exposure—can lower the threshold for attacks.</p>

<h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
<p>The plate captures pathognomonic signs: fortification spectra with a serrated, high-contrast edge; scintillation marked by multicolored fringes; and a spreading arc that often moves across one hemifield over 15–30 minutes. The bilateral yet homonymous distribution (experienced in corresponding halves of both eyes) indicates a cortical rather than ocular origin. Small satellite scotomata foreshadow the main disturbance, consistent with patient narratives of flickering points that elaborate into zigzags before resolving. The clean cartography of blind zones and shimmering borders visualizes the orderly march of CSD at a few millimeters per minute across the striate cortex.</p>

<h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
<p>Nineteenth-century recommendations emphasized rest, darkness, and avoidance of precipitants; sedatives and bromides were variably employed. Modern acute treatment includes NSAIDs, triptans, and newer agents that bypass vasoconstriction such as gepants (ubrogepant, rimegepant) and the 5-HT1F agonist lasmiditan. Preventive options span beta-blockers, topiramate, valproate, and calcium-channel blockers, as well as monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule antagonists targeting CGRP pathways (erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab, eptinezumab, atogepant). Nonpharmacologic strategies—sleep regularity, hydration, exercise, trigger management, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and neuromodulation (single-pulse TMS, noninvasive vagus stimulation)—are supported for selected patients, reflecting a biopsychosocial model of care.</p>

<h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
<p>Work schedules, exposure to intense lighting or screen glare, air quality, and noise can precipitate attacks or impede recovery. Job insecurity and limited paid leave discourage rest during aura, risking progression to severe headache. Access to specialized care and newer therapeutics tracks with insurance status and geography. Gendered caregiving roles amplify burden, as do stigma and disbelief in invisible symptoms. Mitigating determinants—ergonomic lighting, flexible schedules, equitable insurance coverage, and culturally competent education—reduces disability as effectively as any single prescription.</p>
