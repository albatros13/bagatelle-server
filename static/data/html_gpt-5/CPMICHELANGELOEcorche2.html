        <h1>Michelangelo Ecorche (2)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564) was a Florentine sculptor, painter, and draftsman whose sustained study of anatomy underpinned his vision of the human body as a vehicle for expressive power. Sources from the sixteenth century attest that he dissected cadavers and produced flayed anatomical studies to refine his understanding of musculature for sculpture and fresco. The present red-chalk écorché study, associated with his practice, exemplifies the artist’s drive to join classical ideals with empirical observation.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The drawing belongs to the High Renaissance milieu in Italy, roughly 1490–1530, extending into early Mannerism. In this period, humanist scholarship revived Greco-Roman statuary and promoted the body as the locus of moral and spiritual significance. Anatomical inquiry intensified in university cities like Bologna and Padua, culminating in Vesalius’s De humani corporis fabrica (1543). While church and civic regulations constrained dissection, controlled access to the bodies of executed criminals enabled artists and physicians to collaborate, aligning visual eloquence with anatomical truth. Michelangelo’s Roman commissions—Sistine Chapel and monumental sculpture—created a workshop context in which such studies moved from the table of the anatomist to the block of marble.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>As an écorché, the work is not narrative but emblematic: a body stripped to its muscular architecture, poised between the living and the didactic. It recalls classical fragments such as the Belvedere Torso, whose heroic truncation invited artists to imagine totality from part. In Christian-inflected Renaissance thought, piercing the body could be framed as unveiling divine design. The exposed planes of the rectus abdominis, obliques, and serratus anterior read as signs of vigor and moral fortitude, an anatomy of virtue as much as of flesh.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Red chalk (sanguigna) permits a warm tonal range and fine hatching; Michelangelo’s accustomed pressure variations build relief without extensive contour. The torsion of the torso suggests figura serpentinata, a helical energy later codified in Mannerism. Rhythmic parallel strokes model the intercostals and abdominal wall, while selective non-finito at the limbs concentrates attention on the core mass. Balance, proportion, and emphasis align with classical canons, yet the subtle exaggeration of insertion points serves sculptural legibility—articulating how muscles pull across bone to generate contrapposto.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Anatomical knowledge in the sixteenth century depended on unequal access to bodies. Cadavers were commonly those of the poor or condemned; women’s bodies were less frequently available, reinforcing a male norm in art and medicine. Artisanal status governed proximity to dissections, privileging elite workshops. Such asymmetries shaped both what could be known and what was idealized: the muscular male torso became the universal standard, marginalizing other physiologies and experiences of health.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The drawing depicts an idealized, non-pathological musculature, yet it offers a platform to discuss conditions relevant to the abdominal and thoracic wall. Hernias (inguinal, umbilical) arise from defects or weaknesses in fascial planes—congenital or acquired via increased intra-abdominal pressure (heavy labor, chronic cough). Inflammatory myopathies (e.g., polymyositis) derive from autoimmune attack on muscle fibers, while rhabdomyolysis results from traumatic crush, exertion, toxins, or ischemia, causing sarcolemmal breakdown and myoglobin release. Compartment syndrome, though more limb-focused, exemplifies how fascial envelopes become pathologic when swelling elevates pressure and compromises perfusion.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Visual markers an écorché could, in principle, record include asymmetric bulk (atrophy or hypertrophy), bulging along inguinal lines (hernia), skin and fascial discoloration indicating ischemia, or rippling fasciculations from denervation. Chronic myopathy yields rounded, softened muscle contours and proximal weakness; acute rhabdomyolysis manifests clinically with pain, swelling, and dark urine rather than stable morphological change. The present study’s crisp insertions and taut aponeuroses instead typify a normative anatomy valued for demonstration.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Renaissance responses to muscular and abdominal ailments were framed by humoral theory—topical unguents, rest, trusses for hernias, and occasional rudimentary surgery. Contemporary standards favor etiologic treatment: surgical repair (open or laparoscopic mesh) for inguinal hernia; immunosuppression for inflammatory myopathies (glucocorticoids, steroid-sparing agents); for rhabdomyolysis, rapid fluid resuscitation, electrolyte management, and addressing precipitating causes; emergent fasciotomy for compartment syndrome. Rehabilitation and graded loading restore function while preventing overuse injury.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Occupational strain—stoneworking, soldiery, agriculture—heightens risk for hernia and muscle injury, as did Renaissance labor regimes. Nutrition, access to rest, and the availability of skilled surgeons have historically mapped onto class. Gendered ideals of the body also shape diagnosis and treatment seeking, privileging the visibly muscular male. Today, disparities persist: delayed surgical care, financial barriers, and hazardous work environments disproportionately burden low-income populations and migrants, echoing the inequities that once supplied the dissecting table.</p>
