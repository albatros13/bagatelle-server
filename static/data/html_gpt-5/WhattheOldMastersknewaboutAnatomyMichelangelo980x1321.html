        <h1>What the Old Masters Knew about Anatomy — Michelangelo</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564) was a Florentine artist whose lifelong study of the human body shaped Western ideals of the figure. Trained as a sculptor, he treated drawing as an anatomical laboratory, using red chalk to model muscle, tendon, and bone as if carving in marble. Period accounts and later scholarship describe his access to cadavers for dissection in Florence, which sharpened his observational accuracy. The sheet here, with a twisting male nude and ancillary studies of head, ear, hands, and feet, typifies his habit of rotating a motif across the page to test structure, proportion, and functional anatomy.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The work belongs to the High Renaissance, ca. 1500–1520, when humanist inquiry and workshop practice converged. Artists and surgeons increasingly valued empirical observation; civic and ecclesiastical authorities tolerated, with limitations, anatomical study for pedagogical purposes. Michelangelo’s drawings fed major commissions—most famously the Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508–1512)—and circulated among pupils as models. Although Vesalius’s De humani corporis fabrica (1543) postdates this sheet, both reflect a broader shift from textual authority to visual anatomy grounded in dissection and life study.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>While not iconographic in a narrative sense, the sheet communicates the Renaissance ideal of the body as microcosm. The torsion of the back—arms raised, scapulae rotating—signals dynamis, the latent energy of living flesh. The red “sanguine” medium evokes blood and warmth, aligning material and subject. Marginal heads, extremities, and an isolated ear function as emblems of analytic vision: the artist dismantles the body into parts to reassemble a perfected whole. Such studies also carried workshop authority, symbolizing mastery over both natural knowledge and classical form.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo achieves volume via tight parallel hatching and cross-hatching, modulating pressure to model planes of the latissimus dorsi, infraspinatus, and gluteal region. Contour lines harden at bony landmarks—the spine of the scapula, olecranon, lateral malleolus—then soften across fatty pads. Contrapposto and spiral torsion (figura serpentinata) organize the page, while an asymmetrical balance of dense modeling and sketchy pentimenti preserves process. The sheet is both descriptive and generative, transforming kinetic observation into a three-dimensional conception suited to sculpture and fresco.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Access to cadavers was mediated by privilege: hospitals and religious confraternities granted elite artists supervised opportunities, often using the bodies of the poor, executed, or unclaimed. Knowledge thus accrued within closed networks of workshops, courts, and academies. Gender barriers excluded most women from life‑drawing with nude models, shaping the canon around the male body. These inequities echo in modern visual medicine, where atlases historically prioritized certain body types and skin tones, influencing diagnostic training and the visibility of diverse patients.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Read through a biomedical lens, the posture—arms elevated and externally rotated, scapulae upwardly rotating—maps the kinetic chain of the shoulder. Such positions, if repetitive, predispose to rotator cuff tendinopathy and subacromial impingement. Etiologies include overuse microtrauma of supraspinatus and infraspinatus, posterior shoulder tightness altering humeral head translation, and scapular dyskinesis from serratus anterior or lower trapezius weakness. In artisans and manual laborers of Renaissance cities, overhead work, load bearing, and cold workshops would have intensified these risks.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The drawing’s sharply defined infraspinous fossa and medial scapular border visualize landmarks relevant to clinical assessment. While an artwork cannot diagnose, a comparable living posture might present with a painful arc in abduction, night pain when lying on the affected side, and weakness in resisted external rotation. Visible prominence of the medial scapular border could suggest dynamic winging, a sign of long thoracic or spinal accessory nerve dysfunction, or simply muscular fatigue and poor motor control during elevation.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Evidence-based management prioritizes conservative care: activity modification, short courses of NSAIDs, and physical therapy emphasizing rotator cuff strengthening, scapular stabilization (serratus anterior and lower trapezius), and posterior capsule stretching. Manual therapy and motor-control retraining can normalize scapulohumeral rhythm. Ultrasound and passive modalities have limited standalone benefit. Refractory full-thickness tears may require arthroscopic repair with structured rehabilitation. Historically, similar complaints would have met regimen changes, topical preparations, and manipulation by barber‑surgeons, without the anatomical specificity now standard.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Occupational load, nutrition, and rest strongly shape musculoskeletal outcomes. Renaissance models and apprentices endured long hours and precarious wages, limiting recovery time. Today, shoulder injury risk remains higher among workers in construction and manufacturing, and access to physiotherapy varies by income, insurance, and geography. Cultural ideals of stoicism around pain can delay care, while visual bias in medical education may impair recognition of pathology across different body types—issues that interdisciplinary art‑medicine pedagogy can help address.</p>
