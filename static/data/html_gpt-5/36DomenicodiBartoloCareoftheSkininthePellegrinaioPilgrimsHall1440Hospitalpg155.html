        <h1>Domenico di Bartolo, Care of the Skin in the Pellegrinaio (Pilgrims’ Hall)</h1>

        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe
        Domenico di Bartolo (active c. 1420–1440s) was a leading Sienese painter who, alongside Vecchietta and Priamo della Quercia, executed the celebrated fresco cycle in the Pellegrinaio of Santa Maria della Scala, Siena. Trained within Siena’s elegant, linear tradition yet responsive to Florentine innovations, Domenico specialized in civic and devotional narratives. His hospital scenes demonstrate a rare confluence of artistic skill and documentary acuity, recording institutional care as a public virtue.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)
        Painted around 1440–1444, the fresco belongs to the early Renaissance moment when Italian communes invested in welfare institutions after the demographic shocks of the Black Death and recurrent plagues. Santa Maria della Scala—strategically positioned along the Via Francigena—sheltered pilgrims, the poor, foundlings, and the sick. The hospital’s confraternity and civic authorities commissioned narrative cycles that celebrated charity as a cornerstone of urban identity, presenting healthcare as both pious obligation and administrative competence.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography
        The scene assembles a spectrum of caregiving acts: a patient’s legs are inspected; another bather receives hygienic treatment; attendants handle linens, vessels, and ointments. Basins, urinal flasks, and a pharmacist’s mortar and pestle encode late medieval medical practice—uroscopy, balneotherapy, and compounded unguents. The patterned hangings signify cleanliness and privacy; coats-of-arms above assert civic sponsorship. Pilgrims’ hats and traveling cloaks speak to the institution’s audience, while domestic animals and busy attendants intensify the impression of lived reality rather than miracle narrative.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)
        Domenico structures space with measured perspective and a crisply rendered timber ceiling that draws the eye into depth. Figures are volumetric yet retain Sienese linear elegance. The rhythmic alternation of white linens and warm brick creates visual cadence; gestures articulate a legible sequence of care. Color is descriptive rather than symbolic, aiding naturalism. The result is an encyclopedic interior, where architectural clarity and narrative density align to make the hospital’s procedures intelligible to viewers.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities
        The fresco promotes institutional benevolence, but it also reveals hierarchies. Officials in rich fabrics stand apart from patients whose bare limbs and dependence mark social precarity. Contemporary statutes often segregated certain contagious conditions (notably leprosy) to specialized facilities, reflecting stigmatization as much as concern for public health. Gendered caregiving roles, moral scrutiny of the poor, and the conditional nature of charity underscore how care could also discipline marginal populations.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology
        While art cannot diagnose individuals, the focus on bathing, leg inspection, and ointment application aligns with common 15th-century dermatologic concerns among travelers and the urban poor. Likely conditions include scabies (caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei), tinea corporis/pedis (dermatophyte fungi), pediculosis (lice), impetigo and erysipelas (bacterial skin infections), and chronic venous ulcers of the lower limb due to stasis and malnutrition. Environmental exposure, crowding in hospices, and limited personal hygiene infrastructure made such ailments prevalent.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness
        The patient whose shins are examined suggests ulceration or dermatitis localized to the lower extremity—typical in venous disease and tinea pedis. Bandaging materials and warmed water imply wound toilet and debridement. The presence of a urinal flask references broader diagnostic regimens that related cutaneous eruptions to humoral imbalance. Shaved scalps and laundering evoke attempts at delousing. The artists’ attention to reddened skin tones on legs and hands signals inflammation, while the bather’s supported posture hints at debility.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment
        Within humoral medicine, cutaneous disease was addressed through regimen, evacuation, and topical therapy. Hospitals offered hot baths, emollients of olive oil and wax, and herbal preparations (mallow, plantain, chamomile, and rose) for soothing inflamed skin. Sulfur-lard or pitch-based ointments were standard for scabies; vinegar or wine served as antiseptics; honey and resin dressings promoted granulation in ulcers. Cautery and incision relieved abscesses. Diet, rest, and clean linens functioned as core therapeutics. The pharmacist’s apparatus in the scene underscores compound drug production within the hospital.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness
        Poverty, itinerancy, and crowding heightened exposure to ectoparasites and infectious skin disease. Nutritional deficits impeded wound healing; seasonal labor and road travel damaged feet and legs. Urban waste management and limited access to heated water constrained hygiene. Conversely, institutional investments—segregated wards, laundering, standardized diets—mitigated risk. The fresco thus documents how infrastructural choices, not merely biology, shaped the burden of dermatologic illness.</p>
