        <h1>Alice in Wonderland Syndrome</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            The image belongs to the celebrated suite of illustrations created by the Victorian artist John Tenniel for Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865). Tenniel, a preeminent political cartoonist for Punch, helped codify a distinctly British visual language of satire and fantasy. His disciplined draftsmanship, incisive caricature, and control of expressive line made the Wonderland images canonical; they have shaped how readers imagine Alice, the March Hare, Dormouse, and Hatter for over a century. The work stands within the nineteenth‑century tradition of wood‑engraved book illustration, a collaborative craft linking artist, engraver, printer, and mass readership.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            Produced in the 1860s, the illustrations arose from a Victorian milieu fascinated by optics, physiology, and experiential psychology, alongside rapid industrial print culture. Children’s literature was expanding, and the nonsensical, dreamlike narrative allowed social satire to be smuggled into a child’s tale. The tea table—a locus of civility and class display—becomes a theater of absurdity. Simultaneously, medical writers were documenting perceptual anomalies in migraine and epilepsy, contexts that later scholars drew upon when coining “Alice in Wonderland syndrome” (AIWS) to describe distortions of size, time, and space reminiscent of Carroll’s episodes.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
            The tea party tableau layers symbols of unstable perception. The oversized top hat, diminutive cups, and dramatized ears of the hare all play with scale and proportion, while the clockless ritual of tea hints at time’s suspension—a hallmark metaphor for dyschronometria described by AIWS patients. The mise‑en‑scène of a table receding steeply into space and the tilt of figures toward the viewer create a charged psychological proximity, mirroring how AIWS collapses distance (pelopsia) or pushes it away (teleopsia). Even the dormouse’s half‑sleep suggests altered states of consciousness that mediate perception.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            Tenniel’s line is economical yet descriptive. Cross‑hatching modulates tone; directional strokes guide the eye across a shallow, stage‑like space. Proportion is deliberately inconsistent: the cups, hands, and heads shift scale in ways that register as caricature but also evoke metamorphopsia—the warping of shapes. Balance is asymmetrical, with the Hatter’s diagonals counterweighted by Alice’s drooping posture, creating visual tension that supports the narrative of discomfort and perceptual unease. The monochrome palette, typical of wood‑engraving, accentuates contour and silhouette, focusing the viewer on relational scale rather than painterly effects.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            Victorian social codes around class, gender, and childhood underpin the scene: Alice’s constrained comportment contrasts with the unruly masculine caricatures. In modern clinical contexts, inequities persist in who receives timely evaluation for AIWS. Children and adolescents—who experience many cases—may be dismissed as fanciful or anxious, and families without access to neurology services face delays. Stigma around neurologic and mental symptoms, especially in school settings, can compound disability and reduce help‑seeking, echoing how power and voice are negotiated in the story itself.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a descriptive syndrome of perceptual distortions affecting visual size (micropsia, macropsia), shape (metamorphopsia), distance (teleopsia, pelopsia), body schema (asomatognosia, macrosomatognosia), and time perception. Consciousness and visual acuity are typically intact. The most common association is migraine—often as aura—though AIWS can accompany focal epilepsy, infections (notably Epstein–Barr virus), encephalitis, intoxication with hallucinogens, and structural or ischemic lesions of occipito‑temporal and temporo‑parietal cortices. Hypothesized mechanisms include cortical spreading depression in migraine, transient dysfunction of visual association areas (V4/V5), dysconnectivity of temporo‑parietal body‑schema networks, and thalamo‑cortical dysrhythmia.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Patients report scenes shrinking or expanding, faces elongating, or furniture receding impossibly quickly; their own hands may appear giant or far away. Time may accelerate or stall. In the pictured tea party, exaggerated headgear, diminutive china, and the compressed depth of the table resonate with these hallmarks, providing a cultural iconography for subjective states that are otherwise hard to picture. Historical commentary has proposed that descriptions in Carroll’s text of sudden size shifts parallel migraine aura phenomena, a link that has helped clinicians explain symptoms to families.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Management targets the underlying cause. For migraine‑linked AIWS: trigger identification (sleep regularity, hydration, light and screen hygiene), acute therapies (NSAIDs, triptans where age‑appropriate), and, for frequent episodes, preventives such as topiramate, propranolol, or amitriptyline per headache guidelines. Epileptic AIWS responds to antiseizure medications. Infectious etiologies (e.g., EBV) are managed supportively; symptoms typically remit as the illness resolves. Reassurance is central—episodes are transient and non‑psychotic. Education for caregivers and schools reduces stigma, and referral to neurology is warranted if red flags appear (new focal deficits, prolonged confusion, fever, or persistent visual field defects).
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Socioeconomic status influences exposure to migraine triggers (irregular work hours, crowded housing), access to primary and specialty care, and continuity of follow‑up. Health literacy shapes whether children can articulate distortions without fear of being labeled disruptive or psychotic. School policies around rest and screen use affect attack frequency, and cultural attitudes toward neurologic symptoms modulate help‑seeking. Addressing these determinants—through clinician communication, school accommodations, and equitable referral pathways—improves outcomes as much as pharmacologic care.
