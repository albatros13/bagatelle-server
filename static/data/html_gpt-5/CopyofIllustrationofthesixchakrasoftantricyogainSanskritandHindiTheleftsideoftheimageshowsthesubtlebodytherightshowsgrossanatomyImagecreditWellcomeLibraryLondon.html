        <h1>The Six Chakras of Tantric Yoga (Wellcome Library, London)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The maker of this diagram is unknown, but the work belongs to the vernacular print culture that translated esoteric yogic and tantric knowledge into portable charts for students and household practitioners. Its labels in Sanskrit and Hindi point to lineages of Śaiva–Śākta tantra and haṭha yoga. The right-hand figure, rendered in a Western anatomical idiom, suggests a workshop or publisher conversant with both South Asian scholastic traditions and modern medical illustration.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        Such chakra–anatomy charts proliferated in late nineteenth to early twentieth-century South Asia, a period marked by colonial medical institutions, print capitalism, and reform movements. Popular manuals domesticated once-restricted teachings, reframing yoga as a rational, health-giving discipline. At the same time, Western anatomy entered Indian classrooms and publishing houses, making hybrid images like this a visual negotiation between local philosophies of the subtle body and global scientific authority.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The left figure seated in meditation maps six chakras along the central axis: typically mūlādhāra (base), svādhiṣṭhāna (pelvic), maṇipūra (navel), anāhata (heart), viśuddha (throat), and ājñā (brow), with an implied thousand-petaled lotus at the crown. Lotus rosettes, seed syllables, and directional petals encode mantric vibrational theories and cosmology. Dotted vectors align each chakra to the body surface, while the right figure visualizes viscera, vessels, and nerves—the “gross” counterpart to the “subtle” channels (nāḍīs) ida, piṅgalā, and suṣumṇā. The pairing claims correspondences across ontological registers without collapsing their difference.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        The composition is bipartite and symmetrical: a calm, planar yogic body contrasts with a densely patterned anatomical body. Line work is economical and diagrammatic; colors are limited yet coded—cool hues around the throat and brow, warmer tones at heart and navel—guiding didactic emphasis. The minimal ground removes narrative context, insisting on legibility over illusionism. Typography functions as iconography, where Devanagari script is both label and sacred mark.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        The chart indexes asymmetries of colonial knowledge production in which indigenous categories were reinterpreted through European biomedicine to gain legitimacy. Access to textual lineages remained stratified by caste, gender, and education; printed charts broadened reach but also encouraged reductive readings. In contemporary wellness markets, such imagery is often commodified without attribution or benefit to originating communities, raising concerns about appropriation and erasure of regional diversity.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        While not depicting a single disease, the image is frequently mobilized to explain stress-related and psychosomatic disorders. In tantric-yogic terms, illness arises when prāṇa fails to circulate harmoniously through nāḍīs and chakras; blockages at heart or throat centers, for example, might be associated with grief or communicative dysfunction. In biomedical terms, many such complaints map to dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, contributing to hypertension, anxiety, chronic pain, and functional gastrointestinal disorders. The chart thus operates as a heuristic for multifactorial etiologies rather than an anatomical claim.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Indicative signs include elevated resting heart rate and blood pressure, low heart-rate variability, hyperventilation, sleep disturbance, and heightened cortisol. Somatic focal points align with the chakras emphasized here: chest tightness and palpitations (anāhata), dysphonia or globus sensation (viśuddha), abdominal bloating and dyspepsia (maṇipūra), and headaches or attentional overload (ājñā). The right-hand anatomical figure—vasculature, viscera, and nerves—visually legitimizes these symptom clusters by locating them within organ systems.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Historically, practice-centered therapies include mantra recitation, prāṇāyāma (regulated breathing), bandha/mudrā, and meditative absorption designed to awaken kuṇḍalinī through suṣumṇā. Contemporary clinical analogs involve slow breathing to enhance vagal tone, mindful movement, and focused attention training. Randomized trials and meta-analyses report modest improvements in blood pressure, anxiety, and chronic pain with yoga-based interventions. Best practice integrates these methods with standard medical care, screening for contraindications (e.g., severe cardiovascular disease) and adapting intensity to the patient’s capacity.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Stress burdens are patterned by income, caste and class stratification, gendered labor, exposure to pollution, and access to safe spaces for movement and rest. Health literacy and language barriers influence whether subtle-body frameworks or biomedical services are trusted or available. Urban time scarcity and platform-based work can impede regular practice, while digital wellness products may exclude those without devices or private space. Community-based, culturally anchored programs mitigate these inequities by restoring collective practice and respecting local epistemologies.
