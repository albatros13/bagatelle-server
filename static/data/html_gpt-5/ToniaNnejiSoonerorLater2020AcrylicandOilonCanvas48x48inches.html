        <h1>Tonia Nneji, Sooner or Later, Acrylic and Oil on Canvas (2020, 48 x 48 in.)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Tonia Nneji is a contemporary Nigerian painter whose practice engages the body, care, and ritual as intertwined sites of vulnerability and power. Working in Lagos and within broader West African visual lineages, she threads personal narratives of women’s health with communal memory. Her repeated use of patterned textiles and cropped figures situates her work in a living continuum of African portraiture while pressing into present concerns about pain, privacy, and recovery.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 2020, the painting emerges at a moment defined by the global pandemic and intensified debates about health systems and access to surgical care. In Nigeria and across the African diaspora, conversations about reproductive health—particularly fibroids and gynecologic surgery—were amplified as elective procedures were delayed. The Lagos art scene’s turn toward autobiographical and socially engaged practices provides the cultural backdrop: artists mobilized the studio as a clinic of testimony where individual bodies index systemic strain.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The composition centers a seated, cropped figure whose crossed limbs and enveloping drape evoke self-protection and convalescence. The peach fabric reads as hospital cloth or perioperative covering; the patterned wrapper beneath recalls wax-print textiles whose motifs communicate status and speech within West African “cloth languages.” Floral emblems punctuated by linear “stitch” marks suggest sutures—visualizing the internal, often hidden, repair after gynecologic surgery. Circular badges along the cloth resemble clinic seals or advocacy pins, indexing institutional medicine and community organizing. The deep indigo body turns the figure into a silhouette of collective experience rather than a portrait of a single individual.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Nneji fuses flat color fields with hyper-attentive pattern. Acrylic provides crisp, matte planes, while oil passages enrich the modeling of drapery, amplifying tactility. Strong contour, limited modeling on the body, and a compressed space produce a sculptural silhouette that anchors the frame. Rhythm arises from the textile’s repeat motifs; contrast is heightened between saturated blue/indigo and warm peach. Balance is asymmetrical—mass accumulates on the left in the draped cloth—creating tension that mirrors the bodily strain and relief cycles of illness and treatment.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The work speaks to inequities in women’s health: delayed diagnosis of fibroids, cost barriers to imaging and surgery, stigma around menstruation, and the racialized burden of symptoms documented among Black women. In many Nigerian contexts, out-of-pocket payment, uneven distribution of tertiary hospitals, and gendered taboos about pelvic exams impede timely care. Artistic citation of wrappers—objects of public presence—stages a counter-public where private pain can be voiced.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign smooth-muscle tumors of the myometrium. They are estrogen- and progesterone-responsive, with growth mediated by hormone receptors, extracellular matrix accumulation, and signaling pathways. Recurrent somatic mutations (for example, in MED12) are common. Risk factors include family history, earlier menarche, nulliparity, and elevated body mass index; vitamin D deficiency and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals are implicated. Prevalence is high globally and particularly among women of African descent.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinically, fibroids cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure, anemia, dyspareunia, urinary frequency, constipation, and, in some cases, subfertility or adverse obstetric outcomes. Imaging by ultrasound is the first-line diagnostic tool; MRI refines mapping for surgery or embolization. The painting’s suture-like marks and guarded posture metaphorically register surgical intervention and the embodied strategies people develop to manage pain and bleeding—crossed legs, folded torso, and layered cloths.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Management is individualized by symptom severity, fibroid size/location, and fertility goals. Options include expectant management; NSAIDs and tranexamic acid for bleeding; combined hormonal contraception or levonorgestrel intrauterine systems; and hormone-modulating therapies such as GnRH agonists/antagonists with add-back therapy to temper hypoestrogenic effects. Procedural options include hysteroscopic resection for submucosal fibroids, laparoscopic or open myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, and focused ultrasound (MRgFUS). Hysterectomy is definitive for those not desiring future fertility. Iron supplementation or transfusion addresses anemia. Shared decision-making, attention to perioperative risk, and culturally competent counseling are central to equitable care.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Outcomes hinge on determinants such as income, insurance coverage, proximity to specialized care, transportation, health literacy, and the reliability of blood supply for surgery. Structural racism and gender bias shape pain recognition and referral patterns. Religious and familial expectations can delay presentation, while supply-chain disruptions—exacerbated in 2020—limit access to imaging, GnRH therapies, and embolization materials. The painting’s interplay of institutional symbols and domestic cloth underscores how bodies are negotiated across household, clinic, and state.</p>
