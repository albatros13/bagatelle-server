        <h1>Hysteria, the Snail, and the Surreal Body</h1>

        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
        Salvador Dalí (1904–1989), the Catalan Surrealist, fused Old Master draftsmanship with psychoanalytic themes to visualize the irrational. Trained in Madrid and active in Paris, Dalí developed the “paranoiac-critical” method—an intentional cultivation of double images and associative metamorphoses—to render unconscious states with forensic clarity. The snail became one of his recurring emblems, frequently linked in his writings and interviews to psychoanalytic speculation about the brain, desire, and nervous fragility. This composition, with a sinuous snail perched upon a distorted figure, epitomizes his conviction that biology and dream-logic could be pictured as one continuum.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
        The imagery belongs to the broader mid-20th-century Surrealist engagement with psychiatry and neurology. From the 1920s onward, European artists mined Charcot’s photographs of “hysterical” patients, Freud’s case studies, and medical atlases as reservoirs of visual drama. Dalí’s work straddles the trauma of the Spanish Civil War and World War II and the postwar dissemination of psychoanalysis. Printmaking allowed him to circulate these motifs widely in the 1950s–1970s, when the language of neurosis and hysteria saturated popular culture. The scene’s theatrical contortion and surgical precision speak to a period that staged illness—on wards, in lecture halls, and in the press—as both scientific object and spectacle.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
        The snail, with a soft viscera guarded by a calcified shell, functions as a compact allegory of the human nervous system: vulnerable tissue protected by bone yet exposed to psychic shocks. Perched atop a bent, jointed body, it implies a mind–body dyad in disequilibrium, a creature whose slowness and retractile motion suggest withdrawal, catatonia, or conversion symptoms. The hair pooling on the ground beside fine lines of blood underscores bodily abjection and the theatrical register of the “fit.” The tiny, dandified figure with the letters “APO” may allude to Apollo (reason) or to the poet Apollinaire—ambiguous markers that pit classical order or modernist wit against a chaotic, symptomatic body. Needles and linear hatchings read as clinical instruments or vectors of psychic pain, stabilizing the image as a diagnostic tableau.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
        Dalí’s etching line oscillates between anatomical precision and airy notation. The figure’s limbs are elongated, their volumes defined by contour and light cross-hatching, producing a tensile rhythm that pulls the eye around a triangular stance. Negative space dominates, isolating motifs like clinical specimens on a plate. The coiled spiral of the snail supplies a centripetal focus, while the curvilinear locks of hair counterbalance the figure’s angular supports. Contrast arises not from heavy chiaroscuro but from the collision of descriptive line, small color accents, and empty paper, amplifying Surrealism’s strategy of making the marvelous appear clinically legible.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
        Historically, “hysteria” disproportionately targeted women, whose suffering was filtered through misogynist assumptions about weakness, sexuality, and moral instability. Patients at Paris’s Salpêtrière were often working-class and subject to photographic display, public lectures, and coercive treatments. Dalí inherits and critiques this legacy: the spectacularized, contorted body mirrors the unequal power relations that staged illness for male experts and viewers. Today, these histories urge careful, non-stigmatizing framings of functional disorders and awareness of how gender, class, and migration shape access to diagnosis and care.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
        The artwork’s “hysteria” maps onto what is now termed Functional Neurological Disorder (FND), a condition characterized by altered voluntary motor or sensory function not explained by classical structural pathology. Contemporary models emphasize a biopsychosocial etiology: precipitating stress or trauma, trait vulnerabilities (e.g., dissociation, hypervigilance), learned illness expectations, and aberrant predictive processing within brain networks that integrate attention, emotion, and movement. Rather than “feigning,” FND reflects genuinely experienced symptoms arising from disordered brain-body inference.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
        Clinical presentations include functional weakness or paralysis, tremor, gait disturbance, non-epileptic seizures, sensory loss, and speech or visual symptoms. Positive signs—such as Hoover’s sign for functional leg weakness, variability with distraction, or entrainment of tremor—support diagnosis. The image’s arrested posture, precarious balance, and dissociated body parts visualize the phenomenology of agency disruption, while the snail’s protective shell allegorizes hyperarousal coupled with withdrawal.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment<br>
        Evidence supports a multidisciplinary approach: clear, non-dualistic diagnostic explanation; specialized physiotherapy targeting automatic movement and normalization of attention; psychological therapies (CBT, psychodynamic, or trauma-focused) to address precipitating and maintaining factors; and management of comorbid anxiety, depression, or pain. Adjuncts may include occupational therapy, speech therapy, and, in seizure subtypes, targeted education and retraining. Historical treatments such as painful stimulation or shaming are now recognized as harmful.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
        Risk and outcomes for FND are shaped by gendered violence, economic precarity, occupational stress, stigma, limited mental-health infrastructure, and barriers to trauma-informed care. War, displacement, and chronic discrimination heighten allostatic load, priming the networks implicated in functional symptoms. Ethical care thus requires attention to housing, safety, language access, and continuity of multidisciplinary services.</p>
