        <h1>Unknown Bronze Acupuncture Figure (Artist 18)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The maker is unknown, but the work belongs to the lineage of Chinese medical artisans and physician-scholars who produced bronze “acupuncture men” (tongren). These figures descend from prototypes commissioned by the physician-official Wang Weiyi in the Northern Song period (11th century), created to standardize point locations for examinations and instruction. By the 17th–18th centuries, workshops in major urban centers produced refined didactic models for academies and physician households, reflecting collaboration between metalworkers, lacquerers, and calligraphers who inscribed meridian names and loci.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        The object is consistent with 18th-century Qing dynasty practice, when acupuncture and moxibustion were codified through influential compendia such as Yang Jizhou’s Zhenjiu Dacheng (1601) and subsequent Qing editions. This was an era of medical standardization, civil service examinations, and the flourishing of literati medicine. Portable cases with printed or painted instructions made figures suitable for itinerant teaching and clinical demonstration. Cross-cultural contact—missionary translations, Jesuit science, and later European curiosity—also reframed these models as emblematic of a sophisticated, systematized medical culture. Within China, debates about needling versus pharmacotherapy continued, yet the teaching manikin endured as a tangible synthesis of text, diagram, and embodied knowledge.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The perforated body and incised lines encode meridians, the conduits of qi and blood linking viscera and surface. The figure enacts the microcosm–macrocosm analogy: channels map like waterways across a landscape-body, harmonizing yin–yang and the five phases. The case’s calligraphy functions as an exegesis, pairing the image with authoritative text. Historically, some manikins were filled with water and coated with wax; correctly placed needles released droplets—an allegory of precision and the flow of life force. The simplified genitals and stylized features emphasize universality and didactic clarity over portraiture.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        The standing, frontal pose yields symmetry and legibility. Dark patinated bronze contrasts with the warm, inscribed case, guiding the eye from text to body. Proportions tend toward canonical rather than naturalistic anatomy, prioritizing the grid of points. Repetition—of puncta and meridian lines—produces rhythm, while the rectilinear case frames the figure as a sacred reliquary of knowledge. The tactile polish at high points signals handling, evidencing pedagogical use. Overall, economy of detail, axial balance, and high-contrast materials serve the work’s mnemonic function.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Access to such teaching instruments historically clustered around urban academies and elite clinics, marginalizing rural practitioners and patients. Gender norms limited the examination of women; manikins sometimes substituted for direct palpation, yet women’s complaints (e.g., gynecologic pain) were underrepresented in canonical case records. In modern contexts, insurance coverage and regulatory recognition of acupuncture vary widely, creating uneven availability across class and geography and shaping which communities can benefit from integrative pain care.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        While not depicting a single pathology, the figure was central to treating chronic musculoskeletal pain—low back pain, neck pain, osteoarthritis, and headache. In classical terms, these conditions arise from stagnation of qi and blood, often precipitated by “wind-cold-damp” invasion or internal disharmony. Biomedically, chronic pain reflects multifactorial etiologies: peripheral nociception from tissue injury, myofascial trigger points, and central sensitization involving maladaptive spinal and cortical processing. Psychosocial contributors—stress, depression, and sleep disturbance—maintain symptom chronicity.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Traditional diagnostics emphasize palpatory tenderness at specific points (including “Ashi” points), meridian-specific pain trajectories, and pattern findings such as a wiry pulse or dusky tongue. Modern correlates include hyperalgesia and allodynia, reduced pressure pain thresholds, altered proprioception, and electromyographic evidence of taut bands in myofascial pain. Neuroimaging studies in chronic pain reveal altered connectivity in the default mode and salience networks; clinical examination notes range-of-motion limitations and functional impairment.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        The manikin encodes core points frequently used for analgesia and functional restoration: LI4 (Hegu), LV3 (Taichong), ST36 (Zusanli), SP6 (Sanyinjiao), and GB34, augmented by local and segmental points. Mechanistically, acupuncture activates segmental gate-control, engages descending inhibitory pathways (serotonergic and noradrenergic), and induces endogenous opioid release. Moxibustion supports cases of “cold-damp” patterns. Contemporary practice may add electroacupuncture and structured dosing (6–12 sessions). Reported adverse events are usually minor; rare but serious risks (e.g., pneumothorax) require anatomical competence—the raison d’être of such models.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Occupational strain, low socioeconomic status, limited access to preventive ergonomics, and psychosocial stress increase chronic pain prevalence and severity. Cultural health beliefs shape help-seeking: in some communities, traditional therapies are trusted yet underfunded; in others, stigma or language barriers impede care. Policy environments that reimburse nonpharmacologic therapies reduce inequities by providing safer opioid alternatives and enabling earlier, multimodal intervention.
