        <h1>Oedipus and Antigone, or The Plague of Thebes — Charles-François Jalabert</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Charles-François Jalabert (1819–1901) was a French academic painter trained in the Paris atelier system and active on the Salon circuit. A student in the lineage of Paul Delaroche, Jalabert adopted the polished finish, archaeological classicism, and moralizing narrative favored by mid‑nineteenth‑century history painting. His subjects often synthesize literary antiquity with modern concerns, using classical stories as vehicles for ethical reflection and public sentiment.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This canvas belongs to the mid‑1800s, when French audiences, shaped by July Monarchy and Second Empire politics, encountered waves of epidemic disease (notably cholera in 1832 and 1849). Artists and writers used antiquity to frame contemporary anxieties about public health, governance, and responsibility. Sophocles’ tragedy—written during the Peloponnesian War and shadowed by the Athenian plague—offered a ready parallel: a city stricken by pestilence seeks civic and moral purification. Jalabert’s classicizing mise‑en‑scène converses with these dual temporalities, ancient Thebes and modern Paris.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>Oedipus, centrally placed and draped in white, embodies civic authority and burden. Antigone’s proximity and pink mantle symbolize filial piety and compassionate witness. The supplicants, collapsed figures, and a dead child at the lower right index the breadth of calamity—touching households, women, and infants. Pointing hands direct the viewer’s moral gaze, while the temple portico and dark, storm‑laden sky encode divine judgment and atmospheric “miasma.” The scattered laurel and ritual gestures recall appeals to Apollo, binding medical crisis to religious ritual and communal identity.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Jalabert’s composition employs pyramidal balance around the Oedipus–Antigone axis, with recessionary architecture providing linear perspective and civic gravitas. The cool, even illumination and enamel-like surface reflect academic finish. Drapery is modeled with sculptural clarity, echoing antique statuary and reinforcing moral legibility. Muted earths offset flesh tones; chromatic accents (rose, orange, green) rhythmically lead the eye across a frieze of figures. The clarity of contour and controlled pathos align the work with high academic history painting, staging tragedy as a didactic tableau.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The image foregrounds those who bear disproportionate harm: the poor, the caregiving women, and the unburied dead. In both ancient narratives and nineteenth‑century Europe, epidemics magnified structural divides—crowding, precarious labor, and unequal access to clean water and care. The kneeling mother and exposed infant epitomize vulnerability. Oedipus’s stance evokes the politics of accountability: who protects the unprotected when disease concentrates among those with the least power?</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Sophocles describes a multi‑species catastrophe—blight on crops, dying herds, high mortality, stillbirths, and widespread fever—explained within the play as “pollution” from an unresolved crime. Modern biomedical analogies remain speculative. Because the drama was composed amid the historical Athenian plague, scholars have proposed etiologies such as enteric fever (Salmonella Typhi), epidemic typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii), or a complex of water‑borne and zoonotic infections. The emphasis on civic water sources in Greek cities and the simultaneity of human and animal affliction point to contaminated water or vector‑borne disease rather than bubonic plague, which is not attested in fifth‑century Greece as a major epidemic. The work thus bridges moral causality (miasma) and environmental contagion, anticipating later public‑health thinking.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Jalabert encodes clinical cues in visual form: pallor, prostration, and hypotonic limbs in the foreground deaths; caregiver exhaustion in slumped shoulders; gestures of thoracic distress; and clustered bodies implying crowding and person‑to‑person transmission. The dead infant suggests perinatal vulnerability and dehydration or sepsis. The vacant gazes and open mouths evoke febrile delirium and respiratory compromise. These signs are not diagnostic but collectively visualize systemic collapse characteristic of severe enteric infections and urban outbreaks.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Within the mythic frame, “treatment” is juridical and ritual: identify and expel the source of pollution, consult Delphi, and enact civic catharsis. In biomedical terms, the plausible diseases referenced respond to public‑health interventions more than heroics: safe water, sanitation, waste removal, vector control, and quarantine. For enteric fever today, evidence‑based therapy includes appropriate antibiotics alongside rehydration and nutrition; cholera management centers on aggressive oral or intravenous rehydration and sanitation infrastructure. Brucellosis, a zoonosis relevant to herd mortality, is treated with combination antibiotics and veterinary control of animal disease. The painting tacitly argues for collective action rather than solitary heroism.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>War, displacement, and crowding heighten transmission; governance and information flows determine the speed of response. Inequitable housing and contaminated water networks amplify risk for the poor, while stigma suppresses care‑seeking. Religious and civic institutions can either mobilize solidarity or misdirect blame. By placing Oedipus among sufferers, the work insists that leadership, infrastructure, and ethical responsibility are inseparable determinants of health.</p>
