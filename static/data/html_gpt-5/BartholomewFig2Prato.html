        <h1>Bartholomew Prato (2)</h1>

        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
        This gold-ground panel belongs to the Tuscan tradition of the Trecento (fourteenth century), when collaborative workshops in cities such as Florence and Prato produced altarpieces and predella scenes narrating the lives of saints. The work’s punch-decorated halo, tempera on panel technique, and attenuated but volumetric bodies align it with artists influenced by Giotto and his followers. In such workshops, masters, assistants, and specialist gilders shared tasks: carpenters prepared the support, gessoers laid grounds, gilders applied bole and gold leaf, and painters modeled forms with tempera layers. The subject—the flaying of Saint Bartholomew—was a standard episode in apostolic cycles.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
        The panel likely derives from c. 1320–1350, when Italian urban communes consolidated civic identity through religious patronage. Prato’s mendicant orders (Dominicans and Franciscans) promoted didactic imagery emphasizing martyrdom as steadfast faith. After 1348, the Black Death intensified devotional practices, but even earlier, gold-ground images served as luminous presences in dim interiors, visually mediating prayer. The display of saintly suffering resonated with penitential culture and with the era’s juridical spectacles, where public punishment communicated moral order.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
        Saint Bartholomew is identified by the icon of flaying: executioners remove his skin as a mantle. The knife, exposed musculature, and strips of dermis signify the saint’s witness under torture. The cruciform support behind him evokes typological parallels to Christ’s Passion, while the halo signals sanctity. The red garment-like skin visually fuses martyr’s blood with charity (caritas), rendering sacrificial suffering as a path to grace. Such imagery draws on hagiographic sources like the Golden Legend, which standardized episodes for liturgical storytelling.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
        The artist composes a tight, shallow stage with a burnished gold field, abstracting space to focus attention on the drama. Strong diagonals—the stretched arms and opposing pulls of the tormentors—create tension and rhythm. Modeling with verdaccio underlayers and pink flesh tones yields rounded limbs, an inheritance from Giotto’s volumetric naturalism. The restrained palette and punctuated blood rivulets concentrate chromatic emphasis at key narrative points. Balance is asymmetrical yet stable, with the saint’s vertical axis countering lateral forces.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
        Martyrdom imagery both critiqued and mirrored real structures of power. Public punishments disproportionately targeted the poor and socially marginal, while elite patrons commissioned images that encoded authority as moral necessity. The saint’s body becomes a didactic site where spectators learn obedience and endurance. Gender and class dynamics are implicit: anonymous laborers perform violence; clerical and civic authorities sanction it. Such images reveal how devotional culture could naturalize inequity even as it consoled the oppressed.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
        Biomedically, flaying is an extreme degloving injury—traumatic avulsion of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The skin, a critical barrier organ, regulates thermoregulation, fluid balance, and immunity. Removal precipitates massive hemorrhage from dermal and subdermal plexuses, catastrophic evaporative fluid loss akin to high-percentage burns, and loss of antimicrobial defense. Nociceptors in the epidermis and dermis transmit intense pain via A-delta and C fibers to the spinal cord and brainstem; neurohumoral responses drive tachycardia and vasoconstriction, escalating to hemorrhagic shock.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
        The panel renders key clinical markers: longitudinal bleeding tracks at sites of avulsion; pallor of the remaining integument; hypotonic posture suggestive of exhaustion and circulatory collapse; and the exposure of musculature consistent with full-thickness tissue loss. The red “mantle” of skin, while stylized, conveys the sheet-like continuity of the integument and its vascular burden. The saint’s tilted head and slack knees imply syncope or pre-shock physiology.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment<br>
        Historically, care would have been minimal—cautery, wine or vinegar washes, and bandaging—insufficient for survival in extensive flaying. Modern management follows trauma protocols: immediate hemorrhage control (tourniquets/pressure, hemostatic dressings), airway and breathing support, rapid vascular access, and warmed isotonic fluids and blood products to treat shock. Wounds require meticulous debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics, tetanus prophylaxis, and pain control. Where viable, replantation of avulsed skin or staged autografting and negative-pressure wound therapy are considered. Even today, near-total flaying carries grave prognosis due to bleeding, infection, sepsis, and multiorgan failure.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
        Violence-as-punishment, crowd spectacle, and limited access to skilled care formed the social matrix of premodern trauma mortality. Contemporary analogues include occupational degloving injuries in industrial or agricultural settings, where risk correlates with hazardous work, inadequate protections, and distance from trauma centers. Outcomes hinge on poverty, transportation, blood product availability, and infection control—determinants that echo the inequities encoded in the panel’s narrative of sanctioned bodily harm.</p>
