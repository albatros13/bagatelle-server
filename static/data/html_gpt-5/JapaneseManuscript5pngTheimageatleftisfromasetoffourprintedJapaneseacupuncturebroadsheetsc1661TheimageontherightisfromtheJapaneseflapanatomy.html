        <p><em>Caption: Japanese Manuscript. The image is from a set of four printed Japanese acupuncture broadsheets.</em></p>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The sheet is the product of an anonymous Edo-period workshop where physicians and block-carvers collaborated. It belongs to the lineage of East Asian medical illustration that filtered into Japan through Chinese classics and was adapted by Kampo (Japanese traditional medicine) practitioners and itinerant acupuncturists (harishi). The iconography ultimately derives from Chinese models such as Wang Weiyi’s eleventh-century acupuncture figures, localized through Japanese pedagogical prints and clinic wall charts.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        Dating to the early Edo period (17th century), the broadsheet reflects a society stabilized under Tokugawa rule, with flourishing urban centers, rising literacy, and a vibrant woodblock publishing industry. Medical knowledge circulated via practical manuals, broadsides, and guild networks. Prior to the late 18th-century influx of Western anatomical science (culminating in Kaitai shinsho, 1774), Japanese practitioners primarily interpreted the body through Chinese cosmology—qi, yin-yang, and the five phases—adapted to local clinical experience.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The body is shown in profile with the torso opened, presenting the zang-fu (internal organs) as conceptual entities: heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and the triple burner (sanjiao), an organ-network without direct anatomical counterpart that coordinates transformation and transport of fluids. Color fields and labeling distinguish organ domains and conduits, evoking flows of qi rather than strictly material structures. Text columns specify symptoms, seasonal correspondences, and point indications. The scaling of organs follows functional importance within East Asian medicine (e.g., a prominent spleen-stomach complex for digestion), not Western proportional anatomy. The image’s didactic purpose is reinforced by the clear silhouette, directional pathways, and punctate nodes that stand for acupoints and channel junctures.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        Executed as a woodblock print with hand-applied color, the sheet uses confident contour lines and flat washes to create legibility across a large field. Hierarchical placement and repetition of linear conduits guide the eye from head to viscera to lower abdomen. Figure and text interpenetrate, typical of Edo medical charts in which image acts as a mnemonic scaffold for memorized formulae. The restrained palette and planar, map-like rendering transform the body into a navigable diagram—an aesthetic that privileges clarity, rhythm, and balance over volumetric realism.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Access to trained practitioners varied by region and class. Urban patients could visit established clinics, while rural communities relied on itinerant acupuncturists and midwives. Guild and licensure restrictions limited who could practice and learn, often excluding women from formal training despite their key roles in caregiving. Cost and distance created disparities in preventive care, and literacy barriers shaped who could use printed charts effectively.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        Within this framework, disease arises from disruptions of qi and blood, invasion by external “winds” and “cold,” and internal disharmonies of the zang-fu. Many complaints treated—abdominal fullness, cough, lumbago, menstrual pain—map to modern categories such as dyspepsia, respiratory infection, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. In Japan, diet-dependent disorders like beriberi (thiamine deficiency) were prevalent; East Asian medicine construed these as spleen-stomach weakness and dampness accumulation, reflected in the chart’s emphasis on these viscera.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Diagnosis combined inspection, listening, inquiry, and palpation—especially pulse and channel palpation. The chart encodes key signifiers: pathways linking abdominal and thoracic complaints to specific channels; organ regions associated with sensations of heat, cold, or distention; and textual notes tying seasons and emotions to organ stress. While not representing microscopic pathology, it operationalizes symptom clusters into treatable patterns (e.g., liver qi constraint with rib-side pain; lung qi deficiency with chronic cough).
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Therapeutically, acupuncture and moxibustion target nodes along channels to regulate qi, warm cold, and disperse stagnation. Classic points for digestive weakness (e.g., ST36, SP6) and respiratory issues (e.g., LU7) would be selected; moxibustion was widely used in Japan, including direct moxa cones for chronic deficiency. Herbal Kampo formulas complemented needling. Modern evidence suggests acupuncture offers benefit for chronic musculoskeletal pain and knee osteoarthritis and may help some headache disorders, while evidence is mixed for many internal conditions; safety depends on training and sterile technique.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Diet, climate, housing density, and labor shaped illness profiles. Reliance on polished rice fostered nutrient deficits; crowded wooden cities promoted respiratory spread; seasonal cold and damp aggravated rheumatic pain. Economic status determined fuel for heating (relevant to “cold” disorders) and the feasibility of repeated clinic visits. Printed charts like this one functioned as democratizing tools of knowledge, yet structural inequities continued to pattern who could avoid exposure, obtain treatment, or rest for convalescence.
