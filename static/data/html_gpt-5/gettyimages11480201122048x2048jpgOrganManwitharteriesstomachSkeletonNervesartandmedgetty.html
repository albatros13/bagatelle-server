        <h1>Organ Man with arteries, stomach, skeleton, and nerves (medieval anatomical diagram)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            The work is the product of an anonymous scribe-illustrator working within a European manuscript tradition. Such diagrams—commonly termed “Organ Man” or “Nerves/Veins Man”—were copied in monastic scriptoria and, later, in university or urban workshops. The makers were not “artists” in the modern sense but medically literate craftsmen who visualized knowledge derived from Hippocratic and Galenic texts as transmitted through Arabic–Latin translations. Their task was pedagogical: to compress complex doctrines into portable images for physicians, barber-surgeons, and students.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            This image type flourished between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, when universities at Bologna, Montpellier, and Paris integrated medicine into the scholastic curriculum. The recovery of Greek authorities via Arabic commentators (notably Avicenna) provided a theoretical backbone, while the rise of urban hospitals and guild-regulated surgery spurred practical needs. Dissection existed but was episodic and rare; consequently, schematic diagrams complemented textual compendia and bedside arts such as pulse-taking and uroscopy. The period was punctuated by recurrent plagues and famines, intensifying demand for medical guidance and reinforcing the authority of codified, bookish knowledge.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
            The standing male, frontally posed, functions as a mnemonic scaffold. Concentric forms at the chest and abdomen denote heart and stomach-liver complex, the primary engines of vital and natural faculties in Galenic physiology. Linear channels coursing to the limbs schematize nerves or vessels, emphasizing flow rather than anatomy-by-dissection. Surrounding diagrams include urine flasks and a chromatic “urine wheel,” signifying uroscopy—the reading of color, sediment, and odor to diagnose imbalance. Drops of colored fluid, circular charts, and labels correlate bodily states to the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile). The figure’s standardized stance and genital covering mark decorum more than portraiture; the body is a universalized template for diagnosis and regimen.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            The image is resolutely diagrammatic. Delicate brown ink outlines and limited washes privilege legibility over illusionism. Hieratic frontality, bilateral symmetry, and rhythmic parallel hatching on the limbs produce visual order, while rubricated initials and marginal glosses knit image to text. Negative space frames the figure, and small vignettes (flasks, wheels) operate as captions in pictorial form. Proportion is conceptual: organs are enlarged or simplified to highlight function and doctrine. The result exemplifies medieval information design—economical line, modular layout, and didactic hierarchy.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            Access to this knowledge was stratified. Latin literacy limited readership to clerics and educated elites; women practitioners, midwives, and lay healers were often excluded from universities even as their empirical knowledge circulated orally. Barber-surgeons, regulated by guilds, occupied a lower professional tier despite their procedural expertise. The manuscript tradition itself depended on resources concentrated in monasteries and courts. Moreover, much content derived from Arabic scholarship, yet transmission often obscured its origins, reflecting asymmetries of cultural credit and the politics of translation.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            Within the depicted framework, disease stems from disequilibrium among the four humors and their associated qualities (hot/cold, wet/dry), perturbed by diet, emotions, environment, and seasons. The liver generates blood from digested food; the heart refines and distributes spirit; the brain governs sensation. Disorders of digestion (dyspepsia, diarrhea), fevers, melancholy, and urinary conditions are interpreted as qualitative excess or deficiency within organ-humor networks, not as microbial invasion.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            The surrounding uroscopic flasks and color charts encode a primary diagnostic art: physicians read urine hue (straw, saffron, red, black), clarity, and sediment to infer organ states. Pulse and complexion, though not pictured, are implied companions. Lines to specific limbs also suggest venesection sites, aligning symptoms with prescribed bleeding points. The textual bands likely include prognostic aphorisms—rules that correlate visible signs to fever types, crises days, and outcomes.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Therapy aims to rebalance qualities by regimen and evacuation. Dietetics (the “non-naturals”) calibrate sleep, exercise, food, drink, air, and emotions. Purgatives (e.g., senna, rhubarb) evacuate offending humors; emetics or clysters target the gastrointestinal tract; diuretics address urinary sediment; and phlebotomy relieves sanguine excess. Compound theriacs and simples from materia medica are tailored by season, age, and complexion. Surgery is limited and largely external.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Climate, occupation, and diet profoundly shape susceptibility in this worldview. Urban crowding, waste, and famine amplify “corrupted air” and weaken constitutions; laborers exposed to cold-damp conditions are classed as phlegmatic, while elites with rich, hot diets incline to sanguine excess. Gendered expectations and poverty restrict access to skilled care and manuscripts, reinforcing unequal outcomes long before germ theory reframed causation.
