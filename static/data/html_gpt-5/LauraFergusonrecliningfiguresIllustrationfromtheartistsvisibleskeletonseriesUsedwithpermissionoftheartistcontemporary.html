        <h1>Laura Ferguson, reclining figure — from the Visible Skeleton series</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Laura Ferguson is a contemporary American artist whose long-running Visible Skeleton series fuses self-portraiture with anatomical observation. Living with scoliosis, she has worked alongside radiologists, anatomists, and medical educators to study and visualize her own body through imaging and dissection labs. Ferguson translates that clinical knowledge into layered drawings in graphite, watercolor, and pastel, positioning herself as both subject and investigator. Her practice challenges conventional medical authority by adding the first-person perspective of a patient-artist who understands anatomy as lived experience.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created from the 1990s to the present, the series emerges amid disability-rights discourse, feminist self-representation, and the explosion of biomedical imaging. It converses with the long history of anatomical illustration—from Vesalius’s Renaissance plates to nineteenth-century pathology atlases—while absorbing late twentieth-century concerns with the body, identity, and the “medical gaze.” In art schools and medical centers alike, Ferguson’s work circulated during a period that questioned ideals of bodily perfection and expanded the role of patients as narrators of their own care, anticipating contemporary bioart and patient-engaged scholarship.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The reclining pose invokes a lineage from classical odalisques to modern nudes, yet here the interior body is made visible. The translucent washes function like an X-ray or MRI slice, a metaphor for revelation and vulnerability. Asymmetrical ribs and a twisting spine become emblems of individuality rather than defect, resisting beauty’s historical attachment to symmetry. Earth-toned pigments recall aged paper and cadaveric study, situating the image between life and specimen. The closed eyes and turned head produce a meditative, inward gaze, suggesting agency and self-knowledge, while the skeletal motif doubles as a memento mori and a record of resilience.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Ferguson layers diluted color over textured paper, achieving atmospheric depth and a soft, fibrous surface that echoes organic tissue. Line is primary: delicate contouring articulates vertebral rotation, rib spacing, and pelvic tilt. Transparency (glazing) allows structures to overlap, creating a palimpsest of skin, muscle, and bone; this visual permeability mirrors diagnostic imaging. Compositionally, the body fills the sheet but lies on a diagonal, establishing dynamic tension between repose and torque. Rhythm appears in the repeating ribs; asymmetrical balance privileges the curved thorax, while muted complementary hues (greens and reds) heighten spatial ambiguity and invite slow looking.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The image critiques norms that equate symmetry with health and beauty, norms that often marginalize people with visible difference. Access to specialist care, advanced imaging, and bracing or surgery varies widely by income, geography, race, and gender. Women and girls—who are more frequently diagnosed with progressive adolescent idiopathic scoliosis—may face delayed recognition of pain or cosmetic concerns. Ferguson’s first-person anatomy counters a history in which disabled bodies were displayed as anonymous specimens, re-centering narrative ownership and highlighting disparities in who gets to see, interpret, and publish images of the body.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Scoliosis is a three-dimensional spinal deformity defined by a lateral curvature greater than 10 degrees with vertebral rotation. Types include congenital, neuromuscular, degenerative (adult), and idiopathic; the adolescent idiopathic form is most common and multifactorial, with genetic susceptibility, growth asymmetry, connective tissue differences, and neuromuscular control all implicated. Curves often progress during rapid growth, particularly in females near menarche. Severe thoracic curves can alter rib geometry, reduce pulmonary function, and shift load-bearing mechanics, predisposing to back pain and degenerative changes later in life.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinical signs include shoulder and scapular asymmetry, trunk shift, rib prominence on forward bend (reflecting vertebral rotation), unequal waist triangles, and pelvic obliquity. Radiographs quantify curvature (Cobb angle) and maturity (Risser sign). In this work, the splayed ribs and torqued thorax visually convey rotation; the soft-tissue transparency hints at how curvature displaces viscera and affects breath. Rather than dramatize suffering, Ferguson renders pathology as morphology—an alternative visual language that educates without sensationalizing.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Management depends on etiology, curve magnitude, symptoms, and skeletal maturity. Observation is appropriate for small, stable curves. For growing adolescents with moderate curves, bracing can slow progression when worn as prescribed. Physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises (e.g., Schroth), core strengthening, and breathing techniques improve function and body awareness. Analgesics and activity modification address pain. Surgery—typically posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation—is considered for progressive curves roughly above 45–50 degrees or for significant functional compromise; adult procedures may target decompression and alignment goals. Shared decision-making and long-term follow-up are crucial.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Outcomes are shaped by insurance coverage for braces and imaging, proximity to multidisciplinary spine centers, cultural attitudes toward visible difference, school or work accommodations, and caregiver support. Gendered beauty expectations and clothing norms can intensify stigma during adolescence. Economic precarity may limit adherence to time-intensive bracing or therapy. Community networks—patient groups, adaptive arts programs, and disability advocacy—buffer these pressures by offering practical knowledge and reframing difference as expertise rather than deficit.</p>
