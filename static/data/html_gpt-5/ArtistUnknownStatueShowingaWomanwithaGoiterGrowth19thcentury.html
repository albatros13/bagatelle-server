        <h1>Statue Showing a Woman with a Goiter Growth (19th century)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        Artist unknown. The work’s alloy, kneeling pose, and modeled features suggest a West African origin where lost-wax casting flourished among several traditions, including Akan/Asante, Yoruba, and Benin-related workshops. Given the absence of firm provenance, it is most responsible to describe the piece as the product of an unnamed regional brass-casting atelier. The subject—a woman with a conspicuous cervical swelling—indicates a maker attentive to bodily specificity, perhaps an artist who produced votive or didactic images for shrines, healer-compounds, or domestic altars.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        The 19th century in West Africa saw intensified regional trade, the circulation of brass and copper alloys via coastal and inland markets, and active patronage for prestige objects and household altar figures. Simultaneously, many inland communities remained vulnerable to iodine-poor environments, especially far from marine foodways. Missionary and early biomedical observers recorded endemic neck swellings (goiters) in certain districts. Within this milieu, a sculpture depicting visible thyromegaly could have carried documentary force, ritual potency, or moral instruction about health, fertility, and communal well-being.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The kneeling posture, elongated neck, pendulous breasts, and the held vessel read as tropes of supplication, maternity, and offering. The pronounced neck enlargement is not merely descriptive but iconographic: it centers the piece’s meaning on a condition that touches speech, breath, and nourishment—domains often associated with life-force. The vessel may imply a plea for healing, a libation to ancestors, or the presentation of medicine. Thus, the figure intertwines fertility, care, and vulnerability, turning pathology into a spiritual and communal subject.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        Formal elongation and geometric simplification amplify expressive content. The sculptor emphasizes the neck’s volume through rhythmic swelling, contrasted with linear arms and voided negative spaces under the elbows. Surface tooling and patina articulate tactile interest, while bilateral symmetry stabilizes the figure’s devotional stance. Proportion is intentionally non-naturalistic: the head and neck dominate to guide attention to the pathology. Lost-wax casting enables crisp modeling of features and textural transitions, joining anatomical observation with stylization typical of regional brass figuration.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Depictions of women bearing illness often mirror unequal burdens of nutrition, reproductive labor, and healthcare access. In iodine-deficient settings, women—especially during pregnancy and lactation—are at heightened risk of goiter and thyroid dysfunction. Colonial trade policies, monopolies over salt, and uneven distribution of fortified commodities historically exacerbated these inequities. Stigma attached to visible conditions could further marginalize affected women, limiting marriage prospects, economic participation, or ritual roles while placing caregiving demands on families with scant biomedical resources.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        Goiter denotes enlargement of the thyroid gland. The most prevalent etiologies historically were chronic iodine deficiency and, less commonly, autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s), toxic multinodular goiter, or Graves’ disease. In iodine deficiency, low thyroid hormone output triggers pituitary TSH elevation, inducing thyroid hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Dietary goitrogens (thiocyanates from cyanogenic cassava, some millets) can aggravate deficiency. Pregnancy increases iodine requirements, making reproductive-age women especially susceptible. Endemic goiter clusters correlate with geographies where soil and water lack bioavailable iodine.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        The sculpture highlights a diffuse, lobulated swelling at the anterior neck, characteristic of simple or multinodular goiter. Absence of exophthalmos or overt cachexia discourages a specifically Gravesian reading. The artist exaggerates volume to ensure legibility at ritual and social distance. The figure’s calm affect and kneeling poise suggest a chronic, non-acute state. In life, such enlargement might cause cosmetic concern, dysphagia, or airway symptoms; clinically, function could be euthyroid, hypo-, or less commonly hyperthyroid.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Historically, care likely ranged from herbal preparations and ritual intercession to physical measures (ointments, bindings), reflecting pluralistic medical systems. Modern management addresses cause and function: universal salt iodization prevents deficiency; levothyroxine treats hypothyroidism; antithyroid drugs, radioiodine, or surgery address hyperfunction or compressive multinodular goiter. Pregnancy requires careful iodine sufficiency and tailored therapy. Public-health strategies—iodized salt programs, surveillance of urinary iodine, and education about goitrogens—have proven the most effective population-level interventions.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Geography (distance from iodine-rich coasts), market access to iodized salt, agricultural patterns (cassava reliance), poverty, education, gendered food allocation, and health-system capacity shape thyroid outcomes. Political economy matters: disruptions in salt supply chains, weak regulation of fortification, or conflict can reverse gains. Cultural beliefs influence care-seeking and stigma management. This sculpture—by making illness visible within a respected artistic medium—can be read as communal acknowledgment of such determinants and a call for collective response.
