        <h1>Old Age, Adolescence, Infancy (The Three Ages), 1940</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Salvador Dalí (1904–1989) was a leading figure of Surrealism, the avant‑garde movement that sought to reveal subconscious imagery through dream logic and unexpected juxtapositions. Dalí’s meticulously rendered hallucinations, underpinned by his “paranoiac‑critical method,” cultivated double images and visual ambiguity as a rational system for accessing irrational content. Trained in Madrid yet rooted in the Mediterranean landscape of Catalonia, Dalí fused classicizing technique with modern psychoanalytic themes, making him one of the most technically adept and conceptually provocative artists of the twentieth century.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted in 1940, the work straddles the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War and the early convulsions of World War II. Dalí had left Europe for the United States, and the dislocation of exile informs the painting’s theatrical voids and austere light. The piece also reflects the interwar fascination with Freudian psychology, biological determinism, and life‑cycle science. Public health discourse at the time oscillated between eugenicist anxieties and nascent social medicine, framing infancy, adolescence, and old age as distinct medical “problems” to be managed by emerging specialties in pediatrics, psychiatry, and gerontology.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The three arched apertures become faces—a signature Dalinian double image—representing infancy, adolescence, and old age. A candle vessel, desiccated trees, skeletal figures, and eroded masonry act as memento mori emblems, equating the passage of time with cellular decay. Shorelines and craggy cliffs, modeled on the Costa Brava, serve as mnemonic landscapes where memory and identity sediment. The infant’s smooth visage evokes biological potential; the adolescent’s profile is fissured by water and rock, symbolizing hormonal turbulence and identity formation; the aged head, bark‑like and hollowed, literalizes senescence and cognitive depletion.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Dalí uses hyperrealist modeling, crisp chiaroscuro, and polished glazes to lend believability to impossibilities. Linear perspective directs the eye through receding planes, while negative space constructs faces from absence, a compositional lesson in figure/ground ambiguity. Repetition and rhythm appear in the tripartite arches; balance is asymmetrical yet poised. Texture contrasts—smooth epidermal surfaces, granular brick, fibrous trees—perform the concept of aging at the material level. Trompe‑l’œil effects and meticulous edges heighten the cognitive dissonance between perception and inference, aligning aesthetics with neuropsychological play.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The life stages are not neutral: they index structural vulnerability. In 1940, infant mortality remained high for the poor; adolescents faced conscription, displacement, and trauma; elders encountered neglect and resource scarcity. Gendered burdens of caregiving and reproductive expectations fell on women, who lacked equitable medical authority. The painting’s theater of bodies without secure shelter evokes statelessness and precarious care systems—conditions that continue to map onto disparities in maternal health, adolescent mental health services, and dementia support across class, race, and geography.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>As a life‑course meditation, the work invites a biomedical reading across three domains. Infancy: vulnerability to infection due to an immature adaptive immune system, dependence on maternal antibodies, and the critical timing of vaccination. Adolescence: neuroendocrine remodeling driven by gonadal steroids and synaptic pruning, which recalibrates reward processing and risk behavior. Old age: cellular senescence with hallmarks including genomic instability, telomere attrition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and proteostasis loss; clinically, increased incidence of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease mediated by amyloid‑β and tau pathology alongside vascular and inflammatory contributors.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Iconographically, the crumbling brick and gnarled tree embedded in the elder’s head metaphorize cortical atrophy and white‑matter deterioration. The skeletal figure and extinguished‑looking candle recall frailty and mortality, while stretched shadows suggest circadian dysregulation common in dementia. The sea‑cleft adolescent head signals liminality and impulsivity; the turbulent shoreline alludes to mood variability and risk‑laden novelty seeking. The infant’s placid, reflective surface indicates neuroplastic openness but also immunological naiveté—smoothness as uninscribed physiology awaiting environmental inscription.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Historically, 1940s treatments were limited: antisepsis and early antibiotics improved infant survival; psychoanalytic and institutional approaches predominated for adolescents; and custodial care defined elder treatment. Contemporary evidence favors prenatal care and immunization schedules for infants; psychosocial and pharmacologic supports for adolescent mental health; and, for aging, multidomain intervention—blood‑pressure control, exercise, cognitive engagement, nutrition, and social integration. Disease‑modifying therapies for Alzheimer’s remain emergent; modulating inflammation, sleep, and cardiovascular risk shows significant preventative effect.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Education, income, food security, stable housing, and access to longitudinal care shape outcomes at each life stage. Maternal education and clean water reduce infant morbidity; supportive schooling and safe neighborhoods buffer adolescent risk; age‑friendly housing, caregiver respite, and transportation enable healthy aging. War, migration, and discrimination—echoed by the painting’s empty architectures—exacerbate toxic stress and biological wear, accelerating allostatic load across the life course. Art here is diagnostic: it visualizes how environments inscribe inequality into bodies over time.</p>
