        <h1>Plaque of the Hippocratic Oath</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Anonymously produced wall plaque, likely by an early twentieth‑century American calligrapher working in an Arts‑and‑Crafts or neo‑medieval illumination style. The work synthesizes classical iconography and manuscript aesthetics to monumentalize a foundational medical text, the Hippocratic Oath.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The underlying text derives from Classical Greece (5th–4th century BCE), transmitted through the Hippocratic Corpus and later copied in Byzantine and early modern manuscripts. In the United States, ceremonial displays of the Oath proliferated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as medical schools professionalized training and hospital architecture adopted classicizing motifs to signal trust and scientific authority. A New York lobby setting aligns the piece with urban, institutional medicine that sought legitimacy through continuity with ancient ethical traditions.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>Ornament recalls healing cults of Asclepius: vegetal scrolls and serpentine motifs evoke renewal and pharmacology. A medallion portrait labeled “Hippocrates” functions as a civic seal anchoring the text in a named ancestor. Rubricated initials and interlinear flourishes elevate the Oath to quasi‑scriptural status, while roundels and borders echo apse mosaics and hospital coats of arms. The phrase “I will not cut for stone,” historically referring to bladder stone surgery, is embedded as an ethical boundary marker, highlighting the division of labor in ancient practice.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The plaque relies on strong typographic hierarchy—majuscule headings, rubrication, and alternating black‑letter and humanist scripts—to guide reading and to dramatize vows. Symmetry in the side panels balances the dense central text, while gilded tones and acanthus arabesques frame the Oath as a timeless canon. The tactile facture of pen‑made lines and the chiaroscuro of shaded letters foreground craftsmanship, a visual corollary to the artisanal identity of the physician as both scientist and moral artisan.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The classical Oath circumscribed knowledge transfer to “sons” and pupils bound by oath, reflecting gendered exclusion and class stratification in Greek civic life; it also references “free and slave,” acknowledging an economy of enslavement. Modern plaques that reproduce these passages uncritically can reinscribe a Eurocentric lineage that marginalizes non‑Western medical ethics. Clauses on abortion and sexual conduct have been variably translated and mobilized in contemporary debates, revealing how institutional displays can naturalize particular moral regimes while obscuring plural medical traditions.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The line “I will not cut for stone” points to urolithiasis—formation of stones in the urinary tract, especially the bladder in antiquity. Etiologies include dehydration, diets rich in oxalate or uric acid, chronic urinary stasis, infection with urease‑producing bacteria, and, historically, hot climates with limited safe water. In ancient Mediterranean contexts, episodic water scarcity and high cereal consumption likely contributed to stone disease. The clause recognizes both the prevalence and danger of surgical intervention before anesthesia, asepsis, and anatomical standardization.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Typical signs include renal colic (severe flank or suprapubic pain), hematuria, dysuria, frequency, and, for obstructing stones, anuria and sepsis. In the bladder‑stone profile most common in premodern settings, children and adults presented with perineal pain, post‑void dribbling, and straining. The Oath’s proscription implicitly testifies to high perioperative mortality and morbidity—hemorrhage, fistula, and infection—recognizable to ancient observers even absent germ theory.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Historically, lithotomy was delegated to itinerant specialists; conservative care involved fluids, diet modification, and herbal expulsives. With nineteenth‑ and twentieth‑century advances, treatment shifted to lithotripsy (mechanical fragmentation), extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy for large burdens, alongside prevention through hydration, metabolic evaluation, and tailored pharmacotherapy (e.g., thiazides, citrate). The evolution from the Oath’s caution to modern minimally invasive practice exemplifies the ethical principle of nonmaleficence recalibrated by new risk–benefit profiles.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Stone disease correlates with water quality and access, occupational heat exposure, diet, and healthcare availability. Immigrants and low‑income communities may face higher risk due to limited safe hydration options, food deserts yielding high‑oxalate processed foods, and barriers to imaging and specialty care. The plaque, installed in a metropolitan clinical lobby, participates in institutional narratives of beneficence; yet its classical framing can obscure present inequities in pain management, emergency evaluation, and follow‑up that differentially burden marginalized patients.</p>
