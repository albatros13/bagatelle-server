        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        This ecorché study is associated with the practice of Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564), whose drawing and sculptural method relied on rigorous anatomical inquiry. Such studies, whether by his hand or within his circle, served as working laboratories for understanding musculature, tendon insertions, and the expressive potential of the human body. Rather than a portrait, the subject is a didactic rendering of an arm with the soft tissues exposed to display structure and function—typical of Florentine workshops where mastery of the figure was paramount.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        Early sixteenth-century Italy witnessed a confluence of humanist scholarship and empirical observation. Artists and physicians alike sought to reconcile classical ideals with direct study of the body through dissection. In Florence and Rome, hospitals and confraternities enabled supervised anatomical work, while the printing revolution culminated in Vesalius’s 1543 Fabrica. Within this milieu, ecorché drawings functioned as technical diagrams that informed sculpture and fresco cycles, embedding contemporary anatomical knowledge into visual culture.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        Stripped of skin, the arm becomes an emblem of truth-seeking—a visual “anatomy of veracity.” The exposed extensors and flexors do not merely teach; they symbolize artistic power, labor, and divine agency, echoing broader Renaissance concerns with creation and human potential. The arm, a site of work and will, is also a memento mori: the beauty of form is inseparable from corporeal vulnerability. The image thus negotiates between idealization and mortality, knowledge and humility.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        The drawing’s economy of line articulates volumes with controlled contour and selective hatching. Torsion is suggested through the diagonal sweep, animating the deltoid, biceps, brachialis, and forearm muscle groups. Light modeling indicates planes without heavy chiaroscuro, privileging clarity over drama. Proportions remain heroic yet anatomically plausible, a hallmark of High Renaissance synthesis: observed nature refined by ideal measure. The result is both diagram and art—legible, dynamic, and rhythmically composed.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Access to cadavers was uneven and often dependent on institutional privilege. Bodies of executed criminals and the unclaimed poor disproportionately supplied anatomical study, embedding class and juridical inequities into the production of knowledge. Guild hierarchies and workshop secrecy further restricted circulation, while women were largely excluded from formal anatomy. Such asymmetries shaped who could learn, teach, and be represented within the canon of anatomical art.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        Although the sheet primarily visualizes normal anatomy, it provides an apt platform to discuss lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow), a common overuse tendinopathy of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) and adjacent wrist extensor complex. Etiology centers on repetitive wrist extension and forearm supination producing microtears and failed healing response within the tendon’s origin at the lateral epicondyle. In a Renaissance context, stone carving, hammering, and prolonged drawing could predispose artisans to this condition.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Clinically, patients experience lateral elbow pain exacerbated by gripping, resisted wrist extension, and forearm supination; there is point tenderness just distal to the lateral epicondyle and reduced grip strength. The ecorché’s clear articulation of the extensor-supinator mass—ECRB, extensor digitorum, extensor carpi radialis longus—clarifies why load transmission through these structures concentrates stress at their common origin, explaining characteristic symptom patterns and physical exam maneuvers.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Evidence-based care emphasizes activity modification, progressive eccentric-concentric loading of wrist extensors, and counterforce bracing to reduce tendon strain. Short-term NSAIDs may relieve pain; corticosteroid injections offer transient benefit but higher recurrence versus exercise-led rehabilitation. Ultrasound-guided needle fenestration or platelet-rich plasma shows mixed evidence and should be adjunctive. Refractory cases after 6–12 months may warrant surgical debridement. Historically, rest and splintage were primary; today, graded loading and ergonomic adjustments are central to recovery.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Occupational demands, piece-rate labor, and inadequate rest periods heighten risk and impede recovery. Access to trained therapists, insurance coverage, and workplace accommodations strongly influences outcomes. In both Renaissance workshops and modern gig economies, power dynamics between patrons/employers and makers constrain the ability to modify tasks. Education about ergonomics and early symptom reporting—typically more available to privileged workers—remains a determinant of timely, effective care.
