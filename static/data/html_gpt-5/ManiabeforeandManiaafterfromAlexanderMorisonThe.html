        <h1>Mania before and Mania after from Alexander Morison</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        This plate belongs to Sir Alexander Morison’s illustrated compendium on psychiatric observation, produced in the early nineteenth century with professional medical illustrators and engravers. Morison (1779–1866), a Scottish physician associated with Bethlem Hospital in London, used pictures as clinical documents, believing facial expression, gesture, and posture could index states of mind. The series “Mania before and Mania after” aligns with his broader project to visualize mental disease for physicians and the public.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        Created in the late Georgian to early Victorian period (ca. 1820s–1830s), the work reflects a moment of asylum expansion, reformist “moral treatment,” and the ascendancy of the clinical gaze in medicine. Physiognomy and phrenology still influenced interpretation, while lithography and steel engraving enabled the mass circulation of medical images. In Britain, public scandals about Bethlem’s conditions met rising professionalization of alienists (early psychiatrists), who sought legitimacy through visual evidence and case-based pedagogy.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The figure’s constrained pose, averted gaze, and enveloping gown function iconographically as signs of inner turbulence framed by institutional control. The “before/after” pairing (common in Morison’s plates) operates as rhetorical proof of therapeutic efficacy: it promises visible transformation from dysregulated affect to ordered comportment. The sparse background strips the sitter of biography, turning the body into an emblem of illness; the chair and robe, meanwhile, quietly index confinement and hospital routine.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        Executed in economical line with restrained hatching, the image favors clarity over painterly effect, echoing scientific illustration’s emphasis on legibility. Strong contour, frontal illumination, and central placement create a specimen-like presentation. Rhythm appears in repeated folds of the gown, while balance is achieved by counterpoising the tilted head with the mass of drapery. The suppressive palette (monochrome) and voided ground minimize narrative, directing attention to physiognomy and gesture as diagnostic cues.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Such images helped standardize a visual taxonomy of madness but also encoded power asymmetries. Patients, often poor or socially marginalized, rarely consented to their depiction. Gender and class biases affected who was institutionalized and how their comportment was interpreted. The promise of “after” views could legitimate coercive measures, including seclusion and restraint, and contributed to stigmatizing stereotypes of “the insane” as visually legible Others.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        In contemporary nosology, mania is a syndrome within bipolar I disorder characterized by at least one week of elevated, expansive, or irritable mood with increased energy and functional impairment. Etiology is multifactorial: high heritability (twin and GWAS studies implicate polygenic risk across calcium signaling, synaptic, and circadian pathways), environmental triggers (sleep disruption, psychosocial stressors, substances), and neurobiological changes (aberrant fronto-limbic connectivity, dopamine and glutamate dysregulation). Nineteenth-century alienists used the umbrella term “mania” more broadly; Morison’s project attempted to parse subtypes by appearance, anticipating later clinical differentiation without modern neurobiology.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Clinically, mania presents with decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, flight of ideas, psychomotor agitation, grandiosity, risk-taking, and sometimes psychosis. Visual proxies in historical plates include muscular tension, restless posture, fixed or mobile gaze, disheveled hair, and dramatically arranged drapery suggesting movement or containment. The reliance on visible signs reflects a period when observation substituted for standardized scales; however, many pathognomonic claims (for example, reading character from facial type) are now regarded as unreliable.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Historically, management ranged from moral treatment (structured routine, calm surroundings) to now-discredited practices such as bloodletting, purgatives, cold baths, and mechanical restraint. The “after” images advertised the moral-treatment ideal of restoration through order and discipline. Current evidence-based care for acute mania includes mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate), second-generation antipsychotics, and adjunctive benzodiazepines for agitation; electroconvulsive therapy is effective for severe or treatment-refractory cases. Long-term strategies emphasize relapse prevention via maintenance pharmacotherapy, psychoeducation, sleep–wake regularization, substance-use treatment, and family-focused or cognitive-behavioral therapies.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Course and outcome are shaped by housing stability, access to continuous care, insurance and medication affordability, employment conditions that disrupt circadian rhythms, exposure to trauma, and social stigma that delays help-seeking. Structural inequities—racialized diagnostic bias, differential policing of behavioral disturbance, and unequal availability of community mental health services—produce disparities in hospitalization rates, coercive interventions, and mortality. Addressing these requires policy-level investment and culturally competent, early-intervention care.
