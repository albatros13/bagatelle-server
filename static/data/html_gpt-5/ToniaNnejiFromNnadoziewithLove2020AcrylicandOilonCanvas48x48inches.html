<h1>From Nnadozie with Love (2020) — Tonia Nneji</h1>
<p>Acrylic and oil on canvas, 48 x 48 inches</p>

<h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
<p>Tonia Nneji is a contemporary Nigerian artist of Igbo heritage whose practice foregrounds women’s bodies, medical pain, and the ways religion and family mediate care. Working primarily in acrylic and oil, she is known for indigo-blue figures, dense textile patterning, and recurrent Catholic motifs. Her projects draw from personal experience with chronic gynecological illness and from communal rituals, including church commemorative fabrics and family “aso ebi” uniforms, to explore vulnerability, resilience, and collective healing.</p>

<h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
<p>Painted in 2020 in Lagos, the work emerged amid renewed conversations about women’s health access in Nigeria and the heightened precarity of the pandemic era. Nigeria’s mixed public–private health system leaves many to rely on out-of-pocket payments and community networks, including churches, for care. Commemorative textiles produced for parishes and associations circulate widely; they materialize belonging while also signaling moral authority in intimate life, including decisions around sexuality, fertility, and medical treatment.</p>

<h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
<p>The indigo bodies suggest both spiritual opacity and corporeal bruising; blue reads as anesthetic calm yet also as the chromatic residue of pain. The checked red wrapper evokes danger, heat, and uterine bleeding, while the patterned cloth stamped with a parish emblem points to the Church as both shelter and gatekeeper. The seated figure’s hand-to-face gesture implies listening or inward reckoning, staging a negotiation between private suffering and public codes of devotion stitched into fabric and memory.</p>

<h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
<p>Nneji constructs flattened, interlocking planes where figure and textile vie for primacy. Repetition and pattern dominate, producing visual pressure akin to chronic pain’s persistence. The palette hinges on complementary red–blue contrasts that pulse across the picture field, while tonal modulation within the blues models volumes without relinquishing graphic clarity. The painting’s frontal compression recalls postcolonial Nigerian modernisms that fused indigenous ornament with global figuration, yet her surfaces are insistently contemporary, oscillating between ornament, portraiture, and medical testimony.</p>

<h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
<p>Black women globally, and West African women in particular, experience a disproportionate burden of uterine fibroids and related morbidity. In Nigeria, delayed diagnosis, cost barriers, and stigma around reproductive disorders compound suffering. Religious expectations can stigmatize reproductive surgery or non-marital sexuality, shaping when and whether patients seek care. By printing parish insignia onto garments, the painting registers how piety travels into the clinic—sometimes as care networks, sometimes as constraint.</p>

<h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
<p>Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign smooth-muscle tumors of the myometrium. Their growth is hormonally responsive—particularly to estrogen and progesterone—and associated with somatic mutations, notably in MED12, HMGA2, and FH pathways. Risk factors include earlier menarche, nulliparity, family history, obesity, vitamin D deficiency, and African ancestry; parity and some hormonal contraceptives can be protective for symptoms such as bleeding. Though non-malignant, fibroids can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, anemia, pelvic pressure, pain, urinary frequency, and infertility or adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p>

<h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
<p>The painting encodes pain metaphorically rather than diagnostically. Red checks read as rhythmic hemorrhage; the layered wrappers mimic the sensation of abdominal binding used to brace cramps. The dense surface noise parallels ultrasound’s grain, the key imaging modality for fibroids. The figures’ inward gazes and folded limbs visualize chronic illness’s isolating temporality, while ecclesial badges hint at confessional frameworks through which symptoms are narrated and morally interpreted.</p>

<h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
<p>Management is individualized: watchful waiting for asymptomatic cases; medical therapies such as NSAIDs and tranexamic acid for bleeding, iron for anemia, combined hormonal contraceptives, progestin-releasing IUDs, GnRH analogs or antagonists to shrink fibroids preoperatively. Uterine-sparing procedures include myomectomy (hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, or open) and uterine artery embolization; definitive therapy is hysterectomy. MRI-guided focused ultrasound is emerging where available. Counseling must address fertility goals, surgical risks, recurrence, and access; shared decision-making should be culturally responsive and free of coercion.</p>

<h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
<p>Outcomes hinge on income, insurance coverage, distance to facilities with gynecologic imaging and theater capacity, health literacy, gender power dynamics, and the authority of religious and kin networks. Stigma surrounding menstruation and infertility can delay care; faith healing may be sought before biomedical consultation. Community textiles here index social capital: the same networks that mobilize fundraising and caregiving can also police choices about surgery or contraception. Intersectional inequities—race, class, and gender—shape symptom severity, treatment pathways, and recovery.</p>
