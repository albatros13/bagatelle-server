        <h1>Aspirin Crystals (2006)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Annie Cavanagh and David McCarthy are imaging specialists known for transforming routine scientific subjects into compelling visual statements. Working at the intersection of photomicrography and public engagement with science, their collaborations often use polarized light microscopy to reveal the structural and chromatic subtleties of everyday compounds. By presenting a pharmaceutical staple as a luminous crystalline landscape, they bridge laboratory observation and aesthetic contemplation, making the micro world legible and affective for broad audiences.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 2006, this work emerges from a period when high-resolution digital imaging and open science initiatives were expanding public access to biomedical imagery. The early twenty-first century saw museums and medical charities sponsoring image awards and online collections to cultivate scientific literacy. In this climate, a picture of acetylsalicylic acid—one of the world’s most ubiquitous medicines—embodied both the democratization of scientific images and heightened interest in the aesthetics of data, situating the piece within a global conversation about health, technology, and visualization.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The splayed, leaf-like shards suggest growth and regeneration, themes resonant with aspirin’s role in relieving pain and reducing vascular risk. The iridescent colors arise from crystallographic birefringence rather than pigment, yet the palette reads symbolically as a spectrum of effect—from cool analgesia to urgent cardiovascular intervention. The zigzagging chain of forms signals molecular order and, metaphorically, the therapeutic “pathway” from molecule to patient outcome.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Form and texture dominate: sharp, lamellar plates interlock to produce a dynamic line traversing the field. Color is produced optically under crossed polarizers, yielding interference hues that heighten contrast against the black ground. The composition balances asymmetry and rhythm; repetition of shard-like modules creates movement, while negative space generates tension and clarity. Scale is decisively manipulated—the microscopic becomes monumental—prompting a sublime encounter with structure that viewers never see unaided.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Aspirin is inexpensive and on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, yet inequities persist. Over-the-counter access is widespread in high-income settings, while reliable supply chains and clear labeling may be inconsistent elsewhere. Health literacy gaps can lead to underuse in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, or overuse that increases gastrointestinal bleeding risk. Warnings about pediatric Reye’s syndrome are not uniformly communicated, and sex, age, and comorbidity disparities in cardiovascular care mean that the benefits of antiplatelet therapy are not evenly distributed globally.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The biomedical touchstone here is atherothrombosis—myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke arising from platelet-rich clots on ruptured or eroded atherosclerotic plaques. Endothelial injury exposes subendothelial matrix, triggering platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation via thromboxane A2 and other mediators. Aspirin irreversibly acetylates cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in platelets, blocking thromboxane A2 synthesis for the platelet’s lifespan. This single molecular action underlies aspirin’s proven role in acute treatment and long-term secondary prevention of vascular events.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinically, acute myocardial infarction presents with chest pressure, radiation to arm or jaw, diaphoresis, and dyspnea; objective signs include ST-segment changes and troponin elevation. Ischemic stroke manifests with focal neurologic deficits such as hemiparesis or aphasia. Counter-signifiers relevant to aspirin include melena, hematemesis, or anemia suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding, and tinnitus at higher doses. In children with viral illness, hepatopathy and encephalopathy signal Reye’s syndrome, a rare but serious contraindication.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In suspected acute myocardial infarction, guidelines support administering 160–325 mg of non–enteric-coated aspirin promptly, chewed to accelerate absorption, unless contraindicated, followed by maintenance low-dose therapy (75–100 mg daily) for secondary prevention. For ischemic stroke/TIA not due to cardioembolism, early aspirin reduces recurrence risk. Adverse effects include dyspepsia, peptic ulceration, and bleeding; risk rises with age, prior ulcer, concurrent anticoagulants, corticosteroids, or H. pylori infection. Proton pump inhibitors mitigate upper GI risk for high-risk patients. Aspirin should be avoided in children and adolescents with febrile viral illnesses due to the association with Reye’s syndrome; alternative antipyretics are preferred.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Outcomes hinge on determinants beyond biology: timely access to emergency services, availability of generic medications, cost, cultural beliefs about “blood thinners,” and trust in health systems. Clear package labeling and language-appropriate counseling affect adherence and safety. Diet, smoking, air quality, and occupational stress shape baseline cardiovascular risk, while structural inequities in housing and transportation constrain access to preventive care and rapid reperfusion therapies—factors that condition when and how aspirin’s benefits can be realized.</p>
