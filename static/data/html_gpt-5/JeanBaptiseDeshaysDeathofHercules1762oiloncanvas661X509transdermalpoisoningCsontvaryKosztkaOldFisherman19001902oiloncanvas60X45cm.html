    <h1>Jean Baptiste Deshays, Death of Hercules (1762) and Csontváry Kosztka, Old Fisherman (1902)</h1>

    <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</strong><br>
    Jean-Baptiste Deshays (1729–1765) was a French painter associated with late Rococo classicism, trained in the Académie tradition and known for vigorous history paintings. Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka (1853–1919) was a Hungarian modernist whose idiosyncratic style fused Symbolism with an expressive, plein-air sensibility. The two works juxtaposed here—Deshays’s Death of Hercules and Csontváry’s Old Fisherman—present exemplary cases of how artists mobilize the body to convey both mythic narrative and lived pathology.</p>

    <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</strong><br>
    Deshays painted in 1762, when French art was shifting from Rococo toward the moral gravity of Neoclassicism. History painting, valued as the highest genre, used classical subjects to stage virtue and suffering. In contrast, Csontváry’s Old Fisherman (c. 1902) emerges from the Austro‑Hungarian milieu at the turn of the twentieth century, when nationalism, social stratification, and scientific modernity intersected. Medicine was professionalizing: toxicology had clarified dermal absorption of poisons in the nineteenth century, and photobiology was ascendant (Finsen won the 1903 Nobel Prize for light therapy). These currents inform the biomedical resonances of each picture.</p>

    <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</strong><br>
    Death of Hercules depicts the hero’s agony after donning the tunic soaked with the blood of the centaur Nessus—believed by Deianira to secure fidelity but in fact imbued with Hydra venom. The shirt functions iconographically as a lethal second skin; the rearing forms and serpent-like arabesques echo the toxic origin. Old Fisherman shows a weathered seafarer against a littoral backdrop. Art historians often note that the composition invites mirror-reading, yielding a dual visage—benign and forbidding—thereby symbolizing moral and elemental duality. The fisherman’s cracked, sun-beaten skin becomes both icon and index of a life spent under harsh light.</p>

    <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</strong><br>
    Deshays deploys dynamic diagonals, centrifugal brushwork, and a warm, corrosive palette of reds and ochres to externalize burning pain. The loose facture and vaporous handling, typical of Rococo, paradoxically intensify the scene’s violence through motion and chromatic heat. Csontváry counters with sculptural impasto, frontal geometry, and a cool-warm opposition between sea and face. The rugged surface, raked light, and concentrated gaze establish a forensic immediacy, as if the viewer were a clinician assessing cutaneous damage.</p>

    <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</strong><br>
    Deshays’s myth pivots on misinformation and power. Deianira’s limited agency and reliance on a deceptive “love charm” resonate with historical inequities in access to reliable medical knowledge. Csontváry’s subject embodies classed exposure: coastal laborers often lacked protection from environmental hazards, healthcare access, or the leisure to avoid cumulative ultraviolet damage. The painting dignifies labor while quietly evidencing its bodily cost.</p>

    <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</strong><br>
    The Hercules myth maps onto the biomedical concept of transdermal poisoning. Lipophilic toxins can traverse the stratum corneum and enter systemic circulation, producing local chemical burns and systemic effects—an analogue to venom-contaminated fabric held against skin. By contrast, the fisherman’s condition exemplifies chronic photodamage (photoaging): long-term UVA and UVB exposure generates reactive oxygen species, DNA lesions (e.g., cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers), and degradation of dermal collagen and elastin via matrix metalloproteinases, culminating in solar elastosis and actinic change.</p>

    <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</strong><br>
    In Deshays, figura serpentinata, arched torso, and clutching hands signal acute nociception; flushed, inflamed tones suggest erythema and chemical burn. The clinging cloth acts as an occlusive delivery system, intensifying dermal absorption. In Csontváry, deeply etched rhytides, leathery texture, mottled pigmentation, and telangiectatic hints around the nose and cheeks read as signatures of chronic UV injury; the narrowed eyes and hyperkeratotic knuckles suggest cumulative environmental exposure and possible actinic keratoses.</p>

    <p><strong>[h] Treatment</strong><br>
    For transdermal toxic exposure: immediate decontamination (remove clothing, copious water and mild soap), avoidance of solvent spreading, pain control, and toxin-specific management if known (e.g., antivenom for certain venoms; atropine/pralidoxime for organophosphate analogues). Monitor for systemic compromise and treat burns as partial‑thickness chemical injuries. For photodamage: rigorous photoprotection (broad‑spectrum SPF, protective clothing, behavior change), topical retinoids to stimulate collagen remodeling, antioxidants, and targeted therapies for precancers (5‑fluorouracil, imiquimod, photodynamic therapy, or cryotherapy). Regular skin examinations are essential.</p>

    <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</strong><br>
    Occupational exposure (fishing, farming), climate, income, health literacy, and access to dermatologic care shape risk and outcomes. Cultural norms regarding masculinity and outdoor labor may deter protection or screening. Information ecosystems—myths in antiquity; commercial folk “remedies” in modernity—mediate harmful practices, emphasizing the need for equitable, evidence-based public health communication.</p>
