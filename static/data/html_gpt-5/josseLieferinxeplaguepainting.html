        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</p>
        <p>Josse Lieferinxe (active c. 1493–1508) was a South Netherlandish painter who worked in Provence, particularly Marseille and Avignon. He is associated with an altarpiece dedicated to Saint Sebastian, the intercessor against plague, commissioned by a confraternity in Marseille. Panels from this ensemble, including scenes of the plague-stricken, circulated widely after the altarpiece was dispersed, and they showcase Lieferinxe’s fusion of Northern precision with Mediterranean urban settings.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</p>
        <p>Painted around 1497–1499, the work reflects the persistent recurrence of epidemic plague more than a century after the Black Death of the 1340s. Maritime cities such as Marseille, nodes on Mediterranean trade routes, were especially vulnerable. Lay religious confraternities sponsored altarpieces invoking saints like Sebastian and Roch as communal strategies of protection, complementing emerging civic health measures such as isolation of the sick and controls on burial and movement.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</p>
        <p>The iconography links heavenly agency with earthly affliction. In the sky, divine figures and arrows evoke the longstanding metaphor of plague as shafts of God’s wrath, while Saint Sebastian’s own arrow-wounds symbolized both suffering and protective intercession. Below, clerics perform rites at a church doorway; bearers transport bodies to burial; and mourners gesture in supplication. City walls, gates, and steep streets underscore enclosure and contagion, while gesticulating figures and collapsed patients act as signifiers of sudden mortality.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</p>
        <p>Liференxe employs a high horizon and deep, terraced cityscape to orchestrate narrative bands that move from intimate foreground pathos to civic panorama. Linear perspective, crisp architectural profiles, and enamel-like oil glazes derive from Early Netherlandish practice. Color contrasts—carmine caps and black priestly robes against pale, ashen flesh—heighten drama and direct the viewer’s gaze. Rhythmic diagonals (outstretched arms, slanted stretchers, stair risers) generate a dynamic flow that binds discrete episodes into a coherent moralizing history painting.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</p>
        <p>The composition registers unequal vulnerability: laborers and the poor appear as stretcher-bearers and victims, while clerical elites retain ritual authority. Such imagery echoes historical inequities—overcrowded housing, limited nourishment, and hazardous work increased risk among the lower strata. Medieval and early modern outbreaks also produced scapegoating (notably of minorities) and differential access to burial and care; confraternities sometimes mitigated these gaps while also reinforcing social hierarchies.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</p>
        <p>Plague is caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis. The classic zoonotic cycle involves fleas—especially Xenopsylla cheopis—feeding on infected rodents (e.g., Rattus rattus). Blocked fleas regurgitate bacteria into new hosts, producing bubonic plague after an incubation of 2–6 days. Secondary septicemic spread can occur, and pulmonary involvement yields primary or secondary pneumonic plague, which transmits person-to-person via respiratory droplets. The pathogen’s Pla protease and a type III secretion system (Yops) facilitate immune evasion and tissue invasion.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</p>
        <p>The painting carefully notes clinical cues: collapsed figures with ashen pallor, attendants pointing to the groin and axilla (typical sites for buboes), and the hurried removal of corpses indicating fulminant course. Medieval reports describe fever, painful lymphadenitis, delirium, petechiae, and acral necrosis from disseminated intravascular coagulation, the latter giving rise to the term “Black Death.” The image’s emphasis on speed—sudden prostration and expedited burial—aligns with high untreated case-fatality in bubonic and especially pneumonic forms.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment</p>
        <p>Historically, therapies ranged from prayer, processions, and relic veneration to bloodletting, cautery, and lancing of buboes; smoke and aromatics attempted miasma control. More effective were emergent public health measures: isolation, movement restrictions, and early quarantine regimes in port cities. Modern treatment requires prompt antibiotics—streptomycin or gentamicin first-line; alternatives include doxycycline or fluoroquinolones—plus supportive care and infection control. Post-exposure prophylaxis is recommended for close contacts of pneumonic cases, and vector/rodent control remains central to prevention.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</p>
        <p>Trade connectivity, urban density, grain storage practices, and household proximity to commensal rodents amplify risk. Poverty limits access to timely care and increases exposure to vectors. Climate variability that alters rodent reservoir dynamics can precipitate epizootics spilling into human populations. The painting’s juxtaposition of crowded streets, narrow thresholds, and hurried funerary labor visualizes how built environments and work conditions shape epidemic trajectories.</p>
