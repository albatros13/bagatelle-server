<h1>Figure of a Woman with Parkinson’s Disease (after 1895)</h1>
<h2>Paul Marie Louis Pierre Richer</h2>

<p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</strong><br>
Paul Marie Louis Pierre Richer (1849–1933) was a French physician, anatomist, and sculptor linked to the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris under Jean-Martin Charcot. Trained academically and later professor of artistic anatomy at the École des Beaux-Arts, Richer used sculpture to codify neurological “types.” His dual identity—clinician and artist—allowed him to translate bedside observation into three-dimensional form, creating pedagogical objects that circulated in medical schools and art academies alike.</p>

<p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</strong><br>
Produced in the late 19th century, this work belongs to a fin-de-siècle moment when neurology emerged as a distinct discipline. Paris, capital of medical modernity, fostered visual taxonomies of disease through casts, drawings, and photography. The Third Republic’s museums and lecture-demonstrations prized objectivity and reproducibility; Richer’s sculpture participates in this ethos by stabilizing the transient signs of Parkinsonism into a didactic exemplar, reflecting both scientific optimism and an era’s confidence in typological classification.</p>

<p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</strong><br>
The figure’s forward-flexed trunk, protracted head, and semiflexed elbows encode hallmark Parkinsonian features: camptocormia, axial rigidity, and the characteristic “stooped” posture. Hands subtly poised near the abdomen suggest the resting tremor and “pill-rolling” gesture; the feet, close and flat, imply shuffling gait and reduced stride. The neutral base recalls the clinic’s examination platform, symbolically shifting the body from individual subject to clinical specimen. Facial reserve evokes hypomimia (“masked facies”), transforming expressionlessness into an icon of motor impoverishment.</p>

<p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</strong><br>
Richer’s naturalism privileges anatomy: taut tendons, attenuated musculature, and planar surfaces record the effects of chronic rigidity. The composition modifies contrapposto; rather than classical balance, weight drifts forward, producing a precarious axis that choreographs the viewer’s empathy. Light rakes across planar modeling to emphasize bony landmarks and muscular co-contractions. Economy of drapery and props focuses attention on kinesthetic line—posture as narrative—aligning 19th-century academic sculpture with clinical observation and the diagrammatic clarity prized by medical illustration.</p>

<p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</strong><br>
While aiming at objectivity, such “types” could depersonalize patients, often drawn from the urban poor seeking charitable care. Women’s bodies at the Salpêtrière were frequently displayed as didactic evidence, raising questions about consent and the gendered medical gaze. The work’s authority thus coexists with structural inequities: unequal access to care, classed and gendered representation, and the conversion of suffering into teaching material within hierarchical institutions.</p>

<p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</strong><br>
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the presence of Lewy bodies rich in α‑synuclein. Etiology is multifactorial: most cases are idiopathic, with genetic contributions (e.g., SNCA, LRRK2, PARK2) and environmental risks (certain pesticides; neurotoxin MPTP). Age is the strongest risk factor. Neurochemical dopamine depletion in basal ganglia circuits disrupts facilitation/inhibition of movement, resulting in bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor.</p>

<p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</strong><br>
Clinically, PD’s cardinal motor signs are bradykinesia plus either rigidity, resting tremor (4–6 Hz), or postural instability. Richer encodes: flexed axial posture, reduced arm swing (frozen upper limbs), and a forward center of mass forecasting festination. The blank, slightly open-mouthed visage hints at hypomimia and hypophonia. Visible muscular co-contraction in neck and forearms suggests lead-pipe rigidity. Not depicted but relevant are micrographia, anosmia, REM sleep behavior disorder, constipation, and depression—nonmotor signs now central to diagnosis.</p>

<p><strong>[h] Treatment</strong><br>
In Richer’s time, therapy was palliative (rest, alkaloids). Modern care centers on dopaminergic replacement: levodopa with carbidopa remains the most effective for bradykinesia and rigidity; dopamine agonists, MAO‑B and COMT inhibitors, and amantadine are adjuncts. For refractory motor fluctuations or tremor, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus improves function. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation—physical, occupational, and speech therapy—addresses gait, balance, and dysarthria; no proven disease-modifying therapy yet exists.</p>

<p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</strong><br>
Incidence and outcomes in PD are shaped by age, socioeconomic status, geography, and health-system capacity. Rural residence and lower income correlate with reduced specialist access and delayed advanced therapies. Occupational pesticide exposure elevates risk. Gendered patterns affect diagnosis and caregiving burdens; women historically have had less access to advanced interventions. Adherence depends on medication affordability, transportation, caregiver networks, and cultural understanding of neurological disability, influencing progression and quality of life.</p>
