        <h1>Om Sep Fig (2018 78768 468)</h1>
        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
        The image juxtaposes two traditions. On the left is a mid-fifteenth-century French manuscript illumination often titled “Leper with a Clapper,” produced by an anonymous workshop illuminator. On the right is a seventeenth-century Florentine court portrait attributed to the Flemish-born painter Justus Sustermans, renowned for sober naturalism and refined portrayal of elite sitters. The pair invites a dialogue between medieval didactic imagery and early Baroque portraiture that records disease with striking candor.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
        The illumination (c. 1450) belongs to a Europe where leprosy (Hansen’s disease) had long been moralized, regulated by civic ordinances, and spatially segregated in leprosaria. Rituals—such as carrying a clapper—signaled distance and warned passersby. The seventeenth-century portrait originates in a courtly milieu that prized likeness, dynastic record, and the painterly registration of status; yet smallpox was endemic, cutting across rank and age. The Baroque taste for truth to appearances allowed artists to record the disease’s dermatologic signs without allegorical cover.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
        The leper’s clapper, staff, gloves, and mantle form an iconographic ensemble. The clapper served as acoustic boundary-making; the staff connotes pilgrimage and infirmity; covered hands protected damaged skin and nerves while also marking ritualized separation. Architectural backdrops—gates and towers—reinforce enclosure and exclusion. In the portrait, the sitter’s closed or heavy-lidded eyes, mottled facial plane, and calm orientation toward the viewer make the pocks indexical signs rather than symbols. The red garment and dark ground heighten chromatic contrast, intensifying visibility of lesions while dignifying the figure, a counterpoint to stigma.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
        The Gothic illumination uses linear contour, flattened recession, and clear figure-ground separation to instruct viewers; its rhythm is set by vertical staffs and crenellations, guiding the eye toward the emblematic clapper. Color fields are saturated and local. The Baroque portrait adopts three-quarter view, soft modeling, and subdued chiaroscuro. Texture is paramount: the impasto-like depiction of pustules becomes a tactile surface that balances realism with restraint. Compositional economy—head and shoulders against a neutral field—centers physiognomy and condition, aligning medical observation with court portrait conventions.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
        The medieval leper’s accessories literalize social exclusion, codified by laws that restricted movement and property rights. Poverty, nutrition, and crowding influenced exposure and course of disease. In early modern Europe, smallpox outbreaks were felt across classes, but survival prospects and scar management reflected access to attendants, convalescent care, and later to variolation and vaccination. Both images expose how visibility of illness shaped reputations and marriage prospects; disfigurement functioned as social text.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
        Hansen’s disease is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae and M. lepromatosis, organisms with tropism for skin and peripheral nerves. Transmission is believed to occur via prolonged close contact and respiratory droplets. Smallpox is an acute viral disease due to variola virus, transmitted primarily by respiratory droplets and fomites; historically it had high case fatality rates and conferred lifelong scarring in survivors. While smallpox was eradicated globally in 1980 through vaccination, Hansen’s disease persists in pockets worldwide but is curable.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
        In the leprosy image, the staff and covered hands imply neuropathy and vulnerability to injury; the thin, possibly resorbed nasal bridge and distal limb protection recall anesthetic skin, clawing, and secondary infections. Sensory loss, not tissue necrosis, drives deformity, a nuance medieval art conveys indirectly through props. In the portrait, discrete umbilicated papules and confluent pustules over the face are rendered with meticulous point-by-point marks—an atlas-like registration of the papular-to-pustular stage. Periocular swelling and eyelid changes hint at ocular involvement that could lead to keratitis and vision loss.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment<br>
        Medieval responses to leprosy emphasized segregation, charity, and humoral remedies. Modern treatment relies on World Health Organization–recommended multidrug therapy (rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine), with early case detection preventing disability and transmission. For smallpox, historical care was supportive; public health breakthroughs were variolation and then vaccination with vaccinia virus, culminating in eradication. Should variola re-emerge (laboratory or bioterrorism scenarios), stockpiled vaccines and antivirals such as tecovirimat are designated countermeasures.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
        Both diseases intersect with structural conditions: poverty, household crowding, limited access to hygiene and healthcare, and mobility along trade routes. Stigma magnifies harm—restricting employment and marriage, delaying care, and producing self-isolation. Governance practices (quarantine, hospital foundations, vaccination campaigns) are decisive cultural technologies visible behind these images: the clapper as community policing of risk; the portrait as documentation that could mobilize sympathy, legitimacy, or prayer networks around the sufferer.</p>
