        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Gentile da Fabriano (c. 1370–1427) was a leading painter of the International Gothic style in Italy. Celebrated for opulent surfaces, elegant line, and courtly refinement, he worked across central and northern Italian courts before a crucial Florentine period. His art blended late Gothic linear grace with emergent concerns for space and observation, influencing contemporaries and paving a pathway that early Renaissance artists would both absorb and surpass [1][2].</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted around 1423, this panel sits at the cusp between medieval devotional practice and early Renaissance urban humanism. Florence and other Italian communes sustained a dense network of confraternities, hospitals, and charitable institutions that shaped public piety and social welfare. In the wake of recurrent plague waves and endemic poverty, churches and patrons commissioned narratives of the Life of Christ to model ritual observance and charity. The panel’s temple architecture echoes contemporary Tuscan building and civic pride while situating sacred history within recognizable urban space [1][3].</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The subject is the Presentation at the Temple: Mary and Joseph bring the infant to Simeon; the prophetess Anna witnesses; ritual implements and the altar articulate the moment of consecration. Halos designate sanctity; the scroll signals prophetic fulfillment; paired doves (often included in this theme) allude to the purity offering of the humble. To the right, figures of the poor and infirm—one stooped with a staff, another seated with a crutch—extend the iconography beyond the sanctuary, aligning temple sacrifice with Christian caritas: the community’s duty to relieve suffering [2][3].</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Gentile orchestrates an exquisite micro-architecture: fluted columns, punched gilding, and mosaic-like patterning create a jewel-box space. Curvilinear draperies, attenuated figures, and refined hands typify International Gothic elegance, while the recessed apse and colonnaded courtyards trial perspectival depth. Color is saturated—lapis blues and rose-lakes—balanced by gold highlights that direct attention to the Christ Child and Simeon. Rhythmic repetition of arches and measured symmetry confer ceremonial gravitas even as anecdotal detail humanizes the scene [1][2].</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The juxtaposition of sacred ritual with disability foregrounds late medieval inequities. The ill and poor depended on alms, confraternal hospitals, and parish charity. Legal and moral codes could segregate those with stigmatized diseases (especially suspected leprosy) to the urban margins. Gendered ritual is also present: Mary’s postpartum purification underscores expectations placed on women’s bodies in liturgical law, even as Christian readings reframed Jewish rites within a supersessionist narrative [3][4].</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The right-hand figures function as visual shorthand for infirmity. The seated man displays a bared, flexed leg with apparent wasting and uses a crutch; the elder leans forward with a staff, suggesting chronic pain or mobility impairment. In premodern European cities, such signs could arise from traumatic injury, osteoarticular infection (osteomyelitis), degenerative joint disease, venous stasis ulcers, or sequelae of childhood paralysis (poliomyelitis). Leprosy (Hansen’s disease) was feared and often misdiagnosed, though its classic facial and digital resorption are not explicit here. Artists frequently synthesized signs to signal need rather than document a specific diagnosis [4][5][6].</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Iconographic cues include: unilateral limb atrophy and reliance on a crutch (compatible with neuromuscular weakness or post-traumatic deformity); exposed shin with potential ulceration (suggesting venous insufficiency or chronic wound); stooped posture and cane (kyphosis, osteoarthritis, or osteoporosis). The placement outside the sacred precinct visually encodes social distance while inviting viewers’ charitable response [4][6][7].</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In Gentile’s time, care followed humoral theory: regimen, diet, and balances of heat/cold, wet/dry guided therapy. Barber-surgeons managed wounds with wine or vinegar irrigation, honey-based dressings, and cautery; immobilization and splints addressed fractures. Chronic ulcers were treated with poultices and rest; suspected leprosy entailed segregation to leprosaria with palliative care rather than cure [4]. Modern differentials would consider compression therapy and debridement for venous ulcers, antibiotics for infected ulcers or osteomyelitis, orthopedic correction for deformity, rehabilitation for neuromuscular deficits, and—preventatively—vaccination that has made poliomyelitis rare in many regions [6][7].</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Urban poverty, malnutrition, crowding, and hazardous labor heightened risks for injury and infection. Access to guild- or confraternity-funded hospitals shaped outcomes; migrants and the chronically ill often lacked such support. Charity was spiritually valorized yet unevenly distributed, sustaining dependence. Gentile’s inclusion of beggars acknowledges these determinants, making the painting a meditation on how ritual piety must translate into structural care [3][4].</p>
