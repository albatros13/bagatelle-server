        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        This scene, often reproduced in later historiography of the Black Death, is characteristic of a 14th‑century Western European manuscript illumination. The artist is anonymous, likely trained within a monastic or urban scriptorium that produced chronicles and moralizing imagery for elite patrons. The figures’ linear contours, patterned borders, and gold ground place it within the Gothic manuscript tradition. Rather than a portrait of identifiable individuals, the image acts as a didactic tableau, presenting an episode of communal violence through the visual vocabulary of Christian chroniclers of the period.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        The Black Death (c. 1347–1353) devastated Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia, killing an estimated one‑third to one‑half of the population. In many towns, terror and uncertainty catalyzed rumors that minorities had “poisoned the wells.” Pogroms and judicial killings followed in places such as Strasbourg (1349) and other cities along the Rhine and in the Crown of Aragon. Municipal authorities alternated between repression and nascent public health responses; by the 1370s, measures like quarantine (e.g., Ragusa/Dubrovnik) and lazarettos emerged, but during the early wave moral and religious explanations predominated. This illumination participates in that milieu, recording and reinforcing a narrative that tied catastrophe to culpability rather than to natural causes.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The gold background signals a timeless, moralized space rather than a specific topography. Flames occupy the pictorial center, turning the act of burning into a visual emblem of “purification.” The walled city at left condenses civic authority; the gesturing official embodies judgment. Headgear, facial hair, and clustered grouping function as medieval signifiers of minority identity, consistent with contemporaneous iconography that marked Jews through costume stereotypes. The composition constructs a stark binary—accusers versus victims—transforming social panic into a ritualized spectacle.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        The work employs a frieze-like, lateral procession, typical of Gothic narrative cycles. Line dominates over volumetric modeling; color areas are flat but saturated. Repetition of gestures (pointing, raising arms) animates the sequence and directs the viewer’s gaze toward the pyre. The border ornament frames the event like a juridical enclosure, while the compression of space heightens immediacy. Gold ground and red/orange tongues of flame create a chromatic opposition signifying sacrality versus violence. The absence of individualized physiognomy underscores the allegorical function of the scene.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        The image crystallizes structural inequities of late medieval Europe: legal disabilities imposed on Jewish communities, segregated living quarters in some towns, occupational limits, and periodic expulsions. In crisis, these inequities facilitated scapegoating and collective punishment. Visual media contributed to a discourse that coded minorities as threats to the body politic. The miniature’s didactic clarity—victims as a homogenous group, authorities unified—erases dissenting voices that did exist in the record, including municipal investigations that found no evidence of poisoning, thereby revealing how images can naturalize persecution.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        Modern science identifies the Black Death primarily with Yersinia pestis, a gram‑negative bacillus maintained in rodent reservoirs and transmitted by fleas (notably Xenopsylla cheopis). Human infection occurred through flea bites, handling infected animals, or inhalation of respiratory droplets (pneumonic form). Maritime trade and overland caravans accelerated geographic spread, while climatic fluctuations and ecological disruption altered rodent–flea dynamics. Three main clinical forms are recognized: bubonic (lymphadenitis), septicemic (bloodstream invasion), and pneumonic (primary or secondary pulmonary infection), each with differing transmission potential and case fatality without treatment.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Bubonic plague presents with abrupt fever, chills, severe malaise, and painful buboes—most often in the groin, axilla, or neck. Septicemic disease can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation, acral necrosis, and petechiae—the “black” in Black Death likely refers to such hemorrhagic changes. Pneumonic plague manifests with cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and rapidly progressive respiratory failure; it is the only form readily transmitted person-to-person. Medieval descriptions of sudden collapse and blackened extremities match these pathophysiologic pathways.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Fourteenth‑century therapies—bloodletting, theriac, fumigation, and processions—had little efficacy and sometimes worsened mortality. More consequential were emergent public health strategies: isolation, cordon measures, and later formal quarantine and lazaretto systems. Today, early antibiotics (streptomycin or gentamicin; alternatives include doxycycline or ciprofloxacin) and supportive care reduce mortality dramatically. Public health control hinges on rapid diagnosis, droplet precautions for pneumonic cases, chemoprophylaxis for close contacts, vector control, and surveillance in enzootic regions. Licensed vaccines are limited and used selectively; research continues on next‑generation candidates.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Overcrowding, poor sanitation, malnutrition after the Great Famine (1315–17), and mobility along trade networks amplified vulnerability to plague. Equally decisive were information ecologies: rumor, theological interpretation, and mistrust of authorities. Marginalized groups—denied legal protection and framed as outsiders—bore disproportionate harms from both disease and violence. The illumination thus documents how inequity and stigma are themselves epidemic drivers, diverting attention from vectors and reservoirs and undermining coordinated, evidence‑based responses.
