        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This composite brings together works by three distinct European traditions: the Northern Renaissance painter commonly known as Matthias Grünewald; the French late‑nineteenth‑century portraitist Jacques‑Émile Blanche; and the Italian Early Renaissance master Piero della Francesca. Their images are here read comparatively for how artistic practice registers cutaneous marks that modern dermatology would classify as melanocytic nevi.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio‑Cultural context (time‑frame)</h2>
        <p>Grünewald’s early sixteenth‑century religious art emerged from a world haunted by plague, ergotism, and penitential piety; the body in pain was a theological text. Piero’s mid‑fifteenth‑century courtly portraits belong to a humanist milieu that prized ideal geometry, rational space, and civic virtue, using profile likenesses derived from Roman coinage. Blanche painted within the fin‑de‑siècle culture of Paris and London, where medical specialism (notably dermatology) had institutionalized and where the aesthetics of refined decadence coexisted with scientific modernity. Across these contexts, bodily skin marks shift from moralized signs to descriptive features, and finally to individualized physiognomic notation.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h2>
        <p>In Grünewald’s demonic turmoil, halos of light and zones of pallor dramatize spiritual struggle; a depigmented “ring” around a lesion may be read by modern viewers as a halo nevus, yet within the iconography it also participates in a theology of illumination and corruption. Piero’s cool profile diptych transforms facial particulars into emblems of virtue and lineage; a raised nevus, rendered without apology, functions as an assertion of likeness and the truth-claim of portraiture. Blanche’s modern portrait substitutes moral allegory with psychological presence; here a pigmented facial spot becomes a contour in the sitter’s individuality, neither stigmatized nor embellished.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Grünewald’s exaggerated chiaroscuro, agitated diagonals, and tactile modeling of flesh make small dermatologic details legible amid extreme contrasts. Piero’s linear clarity, measured intervals, and aerial perspective emphasize outline over surface, yet he records minute epidermal irregularities with tempera precision. Blanche’s loose yet sensitive brushwork and muted harmonies locate skin tones within a continuum of grays and pinks; the nevus registers as a calibrated shift in value and hue, consistent with naturalistic observation under soft interior light.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Historically, visible skin differences have mediated inclusion and exclusion. In late medieval Europe, disfigurement could be moralized; in Renaissance courts, cosmetic practices and veils moderated blemishes for elite women while laborers lacked such means. Nineteenth‑century portraiture reflects access to medical advice and emerging cosmetics in urban centers. Contemporary echoes persist: colorism, beauty norms, and unequal access to dermatologic care shape who receives surveillance for suspicious lesions, who can afford photoprotection, and whose concerns are dismissed as “cosmetic.”</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Melanocytic nevi are benign proliferations of nevomelanocytes. Intradermal nevi are dome‑shaped lesions with nests of melanocytes localized within the dermis; pigment often diminishes as cells migrate deeper. A “pigmented nevus” is a common acquired melanocytic nevus with variable melanin content. A halo nevus presents as a central nevus surrounded by a depigmented ring produced by autoimmune lymphocytic response against melanocytic antigens; it can be idiopathic, occur in adolescence, or be associated with vitiligo. Genetic factors (e.g., somatic BRAF or NRAS mutations) and ultraviolet exposure contribute to the development of acquired nevi. Most are harmless, but a small subset may evolve dysplastic changes, and, rarely, melanoma can arise de novo or in association with a preexisting nevus.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Artworks capture clinical cues recognizable today: symmetry and regular borders (benign tendency) versus asymmetry and variegation (red flags); the depigmented “halo” sharply encircling a central lesion; and the soft, skin‑colored, raised papule typical of intradermal nevi. Pain, ulceration, or rapid growth—features not easily represented in still images—would elevate concern. The ABCDE mnemonic (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter enlargement, Evolution) remains a heuristic, supplemented by dermoscopy in clinical settings.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>For benign-appearing nevi, evidence supports observation, self‑monitoring photography, and sun protection. Indications for biopsy or excision include change in size or color, symptomatic lesions, or worrisome dermoscopic patterns. Halo nevi in otherwise healthy individuals often regress spontaneously; treatment is usually reassurance plus photoprotection, with evaluation to exclude atypia. When cosmetic or functional issues arise—snagging, shaving trauma, or prominent facial location—shave or excisional removal can be considered, balancing scarring risk. Suspicion of melanoma warrants complete excision with histopathologic assessment and, if confirmed, stage‑appropriate oncologic management.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Occupational sun exposure, latitude, and outdoor recreation shape nevus burden and melanoma risk. Socioeconomic status influences access to sunscreen, routine dermatologic exams, and timely biopsy. Individuals with darker skin tones face under‑screening and later melanoma detection due to biases and misconceptions that they are “low risk,” despite higher mortality once melanoma occurs. Cultural meanings of facial marks—as stigma, charm, or indifference—affect help‑seeking behavior. Public health strategies must pair UV‑exposure reduction with culturally tailored education and equitable specialty access.</p>
