        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            The work belongs to the European medieval anatomical illustration tradition associated with university medicine, in the milieu of figures such as Mondino de’ Luzzi and Guido da Vigevano. While specific authorship here is uncertain, the image typifies the workshop practice of scholastic book production in which physicians, surgeons, and scribes collaborated to visualize didactic anatomy. The anonymous illustrator renders the anatomist as a learned practitioner, marked by scholarly dress, and the cadaver as a highly schematized figure meant to instruct rather than to mirror naturalistic observation.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            The iconography corresponds to the 14th–early 15th centuries, when Italian and French universities normalized public anatomies as annual or occasional events. Bologna, Padua, and later Paris institutionalized dissection within a scholastic curriculum grounded in Galenic and Avicennian authorities, even as observation slowly gained weight. The Black Death (mid-14th century) intensified medical scrutiny of the body and mortality, while ecclesiastical practice generally permitted regulated dissection for teaching. Textual glosses in Latin and vernacular languages often accompanied such images, organizing knowledge in marginal notes for student readers.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
            The composition features the anatomist positioned behind the upright cadaver, guiding a cervico-thoracic incision. The pose sets up a master–exemplar relationship: the living mediates the silent, didactic body. The cadaver’s attenuated flesh and exposed ribs fuse two genres—the “transi” or cadaver figure (memento mori) and the pedagogical chart. The red incision band dramatizes the path of entry into the thorax, neck, and great vessels, signaling both practical technique and the threshold between life and death. Script panels authenticate the image as a page for study, not a theatrical scene.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            Line dominates: firm contours, planar color fields, and limited modeling flatten space and emphasize legibility over realism. Proportions are elongated and symmetrical, guiding the eye vertically along the incision path. Negative space suppresses distractions, while the restrained palette—grays for the cadaver, pale tones for the anatomist, strategic reds—functions indexically to mark anatomy and action. Hieratic frontality, minimal depth cues, and rubricated text align the image with manuscript conventions, privileging clarity and mnemonic value.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            Bodies for dissection were typically sourced from executed criminals, the poor, and other marginalized groups whose remains were legally or socially more accessible, entangling the growth of anatomical knowledge with structural inequity. Access to university anatomies skewed toward male, Latin-literate elites; women and lay healers were largely excluded from formal settings. This asymmetry—who could learn, who was examined, and whose body became a text—shaped the archive of early biomedical knowledge and echoes in modern debates over consent and representation in medical collections.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            Though not depicting a specific case history, the cadaver’s extreme emaciation prompts discussion of a prevalent medieval illness: pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and transmitted via aerosolized droplets, TB thrived in crowded, poorly ventilated urban environments. Chronic infection produced wasting (“consumption”), intermittent fever, cough, and hemoptysis. In skeletal terms, TB can involve the spine (Pott’s disease) and ribs, leaving recognizable lesions in some remains. Before germ theory, etiology was framed humoral-ly; later bacteriological discovery in the 19th century clarified airborne transmission and pathogen biology.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Medieval artists used the withered body as a general signifier of illness and mortality. While this image is schematic, TB’s material signatures in the body include vertebral collapse from granulomatous infection, periosteal reaction on ribs, and kyphosis in advanced spinal involvement. Soft-tissue pathology—cavitary lung disease, caseating necrosis—would be accessible only through incisions such as the cervico-thoracic cut indicated here, which could expose trachea, bronchi, great vessels, and thoracic cavity for inspection during teaching anatomies.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            In the medieval framework, TB-like wasting was treated by regimen: warm, dry air; nourishing but balanced diet; rest; and sometimes bloodletting or herbal expectorants aligned with humoral correction. Quarantine-like separation was variably practiced. Modern evidence-based therapy requires multi-drug regimens (e.g., isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide) for months, with attention to drug susceptibility and adherence. Public health measures—ventilation, early detection, and social support—are essential adjuncts to pharmacologic cure and prevention of transmission.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            TB’s incidence historically tracks poverty, crowding, malnutrition, and occupational exposure—conditions common in medieval towns and still unevenly distributed today. Stigma and legal status shaped who was isolated, who sought care, and whose illness was recorded. The same inequities that supplied cadavers to anatomy theaters—marginality, lack of social power—also amplified vulnerability to infectious disease. Addressing TB requires structural interventions: improved housing, nutrition, labor protections, and equitable access to diagnosis and treatment.
