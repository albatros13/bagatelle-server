        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Gustave Doré (1832–1883) was a French printmaker and illustrator renowned for transforming literary epics into vivid visual dramas through large-scale wood engravings. His studio practice involved designing drawings that teams of professional engravers translated into blocks, a collaborative mode typical of nineteenth‑century illustrated publishing. This plate visualizes a moment from Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a Romantic poem whose maritime setting made it an ideal vehicle for Doré’s taste for the sublime and the grotesque.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Doré’s suite for the poem appeared in the mid‑1870s during the high tide of Victorian book culture, when illustrated editions became prestige objects for a rising middle class. The image also resonates with the era’s imperial seafaring and polar exploration, ventures that brought crews into environments of isolation, preserved rations, and vitamin‑poor diets. Although the Royal Navy had adopted citrus decades earlier, outbreaks of deficiency diseases persisted ashore and at sea whenever provisioning failed or heat-processed stores degraded nutrients—an enduring shadow of the Age of Sail described by Coleridge in 1798.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The engraving centers on the albatross, an omen in the poem that marks the turning point between hope and doom. The bird perches amid rigging sheathed in ice; clustered sailors reach out with a mixture of awe and desperation, while a figure slumps in the hatchway. Chains, spars, and icicles form a cage-like lattice, connoting entrapment. Barrels and coiled lines evoke stored provisions, a reminder that survival depends on supplies whose inadequacy historically precipitated scurvy. Doré mobilizes this iconography to fuse moral transgression and environmental peril with the material realities of shipboard life.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Doré’s virtuoso chiaroscuro orchestrates attention: radiant light isolates the albatross and faces, while cavernous shadows engulf the hull and sky. Dense cross‑hatching renders the tactile brittleness of ice and the worn grain of timber. Diagonal rigging leads the eye into depth, generating tension and movement. Repetition of chain links and figures builds rhythm, and the scale contrast between bird and crew intensifies the uncanny. The composition balances narrative clarity with atmospheric ambiguity, a hallmark of Doré’s ability to translate poetry into a theatrically staged tableau.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Seafaring health was inseparable from hierarchy and economics. Officers controlled procurement and storage; ordinary sailors, including conscripts and global laborers such as Lascars, bore the risks of inadequate rations and cramped, unsanitary quarters. Even after empirical demonstrations of citrus efficacy, institutional inertia, cost, and spoilage sometimes prevented delivery. Onshore, the urban poor and incarcerated populations experienced similar deficiencies. Doré’s tableau—crowded bodies, scant supplies, and an indifferent environment—mirrors inequities wherein knowledge existed but structural conditions curtailed access to preventive nutrition.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Scurvy results from dietary deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Ascorbate is a cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases essential to collagen stabilization; deficiency undermines blood vessels, gingiva, skin, bone, and wound repair. It also participates in carnitine synthesis and neurotransmitter metabolism, contributing to fatigue and mood changes. Humans cannot synthesize vitamin C and depend on fresh fruits and vegetables; heating, prolonged storage, and desalination can drastically reduce content. Deficiency typically appears after one to three months of intake below 10 mg/day.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinically, scurvy manifests as lassitude, perifollicular hemorrhages with corkscrew hairs, petechiae and ecchymoses, edematous bleeding gums, tooth loss, musculoskeletal pain, anemia, and impaired wound healing; in children, bone changes and growth arrest occur. In Doré’s scene, the collapsed mariner and gaunt, pleading faces echo fatigue and malaise, while frigid conditions would worsen vasoconstriction and tissue vulnerability. Art cannot diagnose, yet the image captures the psychosocial signature of deficiency—desperation for relief symbolized by the portentous bird and the frozen, nutrient‑void seascape.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Historically, James Lind’s 1747 shipboard trial demonstrated citrus as effective therapy; systematic naval provisioning with lemon/lime juice followed, though unevenly. Modern treatment is straightforward: oral ascorbic acid, commonly 100–500 mg daily (up to 1000 mg initially), with clinical improvement often within days and resolution in several weeks, alongside dietary replenishment of fresh produce. Management includes addressing anemia, dental disease, and coexisting malnutrition. Prevention requires reliable access to vitamin‑C–rich foods and minimizing over‑processing that destroys ascorbate.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Provisioning systems, supply-chain reliability, food preservation technology, and labor power relations shape exposure to scurvy. Long voyages, polar climates, and reliance on salted meat and heat‑processed tinned foods accelerate micronutrient loss. Knowledge translation (from scientific findings to procurement policy), class and rank, and colonial trade patterns determined who received fresh produce and when. The engraving’s crowded deck, icy isolation, and meager stores visualize these determinants: illness as a product not only of biology but of logistics, governance, and economy.</p>
