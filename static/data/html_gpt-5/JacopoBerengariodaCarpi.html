<h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
<p>Jacopo Berengario da Carpi (c. 1466–1530) was an Italian anatomist-surgeon and professor at the University of Bologna. He stands at a pivotal moment between medieval scholastic anatomy and the observational rigor that culminated with Vesalius. Berengario is celebrated for introducing large-format, empirically grounded woodcut images into printed anatomy, particularly in his Commentaria cum amplissimis additionibus super Anatomia Mundini (1521) and the concise Isagogae breves (1522). His works distilled surgical experience, dissection-based pedagogy, and the artisan skills of printers and block-cutters into a new visual language for anatomy.</p>

<h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
<p>Produced in early sixteenth-century Italy, this image belongs to a period of rapid transformation: universities increasingly sanctioned human dissection; printing houses diffused technical knowledge; and humanist scholarship returned to classical models of proportion and form. The figure predates Vesalius’s Fabrica (1543) yet already asserts the authority of firsthand observation over medieval diagrammatic traditions derived from Mondino de Luzzi (1316). The backdrop includes the social reality of recurrent plague, warfare, and the “French disease” (syphilis), which together spurred surgical and anatomical inquiry. Patronage networks and the commercial print market also shaped what could be shown and who could access it.</p>

<h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
<p>The flayed “muscle-man” (écorché) lays bare the body as a readable text—an emblem of Renaissance knowledge. Radiating lines act like a nimbus of illumination, suggesting both revelation and the diffusion of medical truth through print. The contrapposto stance, echoing classical statuary, invests the medical specimen with human dignity and idealized proportion, conflating the antique canon with anatomical empiricism. The draped skin, worn like an apron, allegorizes the threshold between appearance and inner structure, reminding viewers that sight—properly disciplined—grants access to hidden causes.</p>

<h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
<p>As a woodcut, the image relies on incisive contour and directional hatching to model volume. Parallel striations map muscular fiber orientation—pectoralis, rectus abdominis, and thigh compartments—combining didactic clarity with rhythmic pattern. The high-contrast black lines against pale ground sharpen legibility at page scale, essential for classroom or bench-side use. While proportional canons borrow from classicism, certain insertions and tendon transitions are simplified or displaced—typical of pre-Vesalian synthesis—revealing the tension between observational data and the graphic economy of relief print.</p>

<h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
<p>The cadavers enabling such images were often those of executed criminals, the poor, or otherwise marginalized persons, reflecting unequal burdens in the production of medical knowledge. Male bodies dominated the visual record, entrenching gender biases in anatomical generalization. Literacy, cost of books, and university affiliation further restricted access to this knowledge, even as print nominally democratized it. Artisans—block cutters, printers, colorists—contributed materially but were rarely credited, exemplifying knowledge hierarchies in the medical-visual economy.</p>

<h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
<p>Although the image is not a pathological plate, its focus on soft tissues invites reflection on a major biomedical concern of Berengario’s time: syphilis. The etiologic agent, Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, is a motile spirochete transmitted primarily through sexual contact, transplacentally (congenital syphilis), and less commonly via blood exposure. Following a late fifteenth-century pandemic wave, the disease’s protean manifestations made it central to early modern debates about contagion, therapy, and bodily decay—contexts in which anatomists refined their attention to skin, fascia, lymphatic drainage, and vascular routes.</p>

<h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
<p>Syphilis progresses through stages. Primary infection presents with a painless chancre at the inoculation site and regional lymphadenopathy. Secondary disease produces systemic signs—fever, malaise, mucocutaneous lesions, and the characteristic palmar-plantar rash—reflecting hematogenous spread. Without treatment, latent infection may progress to tertiary syphilis with gummatous destruction, cardiovascular involvement (e.g., aortitis), and neurosyphilis. Osteoperiosteal changes—saber shins, caries sicca—became recognizable in skeletal collections, linking pathological anatomy with clinical observation. Congenital syphilis imparts stigmata including Hutchinson teeth and interstitial keratitis.</p>

<h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
<p>In Berengario’s milieu, therapies included mercury inunctions and fumigations and the New World wood guaiacum—interventions framed by humoral logic and experiential report. Surgical management addressed sequelae such as ulceration or nasal collapse, but without eradicating cause. Modern therapy is penicillin G (parenteral benzathine penicillin for early stages; aqueous crystalline penicillin for neurosyphilis), with attention to the Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction after initial dosing. Early detection and contact tracing remain key to interrupting transmission chains.</p>

<h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
<p>Then as now, syphilis tracks along vectors of mobility, poverty, stigma, and unequal access to healthcare. Military campaigns, urban brothels, and itinerant labor facilitated transmission in the sixteenth century, while moralization of sexual behavior impeded disclosure and care. Print culture paradoxically widened knowledge yet did not guarantee equitable treatment. Contemporary determinants—housing insecurity, healthcare access, structural racism, and punitive approaches to sex work—continue to shape incidence and outcomes, reminding us that technical understanding of bodies must be paired with social remedies.</p>
