        <h1>Phlebotomy Man (Vein Man), late 15th century</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The work belongs to the anonymous workshop tradition of early European printmakers producing medical illustrations for physicians, barber–surgeons, and university students. It is closely related to sheets included in the widely circulated Fasciculus Medicinae, a compendium attributed to the physician Johannes de Ketham (Venice, 1491). While the compiler is known, the woodcuts were executed by professional block cutters working in concert with printers; the “author” here is best understood as a collective of humanist editors, medical practitioners, and craftsmen embedded in the emergent print trade of northern Italy and the German lands.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        Produced in the late medieval to early Renaissance transition (c. 1480–1500), the sheet exemplifies how the press transformed medical pedagogy. Universities at Bologna and Padua taught Galenic and Avicennian medicine through Latin texts; simultaneously, urban craft guilds trained barber–surgeons in practical procedures such as venesection. Visual schemata like this one bridged elite book learning and hands-on practice. Astrological medicine still structured therapeutic timing, while public health crises—plague aftershocks, recurrent fevers, malnutrition—created demand for standardized, portable guides. The sheet’s fusion of image and dense Latin notes reflects scholastic habits of excerpting authorities and indexing knowledge for rapid consultation at the bedside or shop.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The standing nude figure is not an individualized portrait but an abstracted “Everyman” body, a diagrammatic type. Networks of labeled lines identify veins of the head, arms, trunk, and legs, each tethered to text boxes prescribing indications, cautions, and seasonal or astrological conditions for bleeding. Where other contemporary diagrams include the zodiac, this phlebotomy man concentrates on the vascular map and decision rules: which vessel to open for disorders of the eyes, head pain, pleurisy, or uterine complaints. The iconography encodes the humoral doctrine—blood as a humor that can be redirected or removed to restore balance—rendered legible as a navigable chart.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        The medium is relief woodcut integrated with movable type, yielding a tight interplay between black linear contour and textual density. The line is deliberately schematic: even, economical strokes describe vessels, joints, and features while resisting anatomical naturalism. Spatial depth is suppressed in favor of flat legibility; hierarchy is achieved through scale (the body as dominant field), directional pointers, and typographic blocks that function as captions. Repetition and rhythm occur in the branching of veins, visually echoing botanical diagrams and contemporary mapping. The result is both image and instrument—an early infographic optimized for mnemonic retention and procedural clarity.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Although printed guides widened access to medical knowledge, literacy, Latin training, and the cost of books preserved hierarchies. The “universal” body depicted is implicitly male and European, overlooking gendered anatomy and the embodied experiences of women and marginalized communities. Barber–surgeons, often lower in status than university physicians, shouldered the risks of bloodletting; their clients were frequently the urban poor. Misapplications of regimen—sometimes urged by authority—could disproportionately harm those without means to seek second opinions or post-procedural care.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        Within humoral theory, illness arises from dyscrasia—an imbalance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile). Excess heat and moisture (a sanguine surplus) was implicated in fevers, headaches, epistaxis, inflammations, and certain gynecological conditions; obstructed or “corrupted” blood was thought to congest organs. Phlebotomy was prescribed to evacuate excess humor, divert blood from an afflicted region, or “revive” stagnant circulation. Etiologies blended environmental and cosmic factors: season, age, diet, climate, and planetary configurations could incline the body to imbalance.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Diagnostic cues highlighted in accompanying texts include pulse quality, facial coloration, localized pain, vertigo, ocular redness, pleuritic stitches, and limb swelling. Classical signs of inflammation—rubor, calor, tumor, dolor—guided the choice of site and quantity to bleed. Urinalysis and stool observation, though not pictured here, were read alongside vascular charts. Headache with bloodshot eyes might direct the practitioner to open a cephalic vein; pleurisy to the basilic; uterine congestion to the saphenous or to scarification near the ankle—each decision mapped to this visual algorithm.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        The core intervention is venesection: puncturing a named vein with a lancet, sometimes preceded by warming and followed by bandaging and dietetic regimen. Adjuncts included scarification, cupping, and purgatives. Timing was synchronized with the patient’s age, season, and sometimes lunar phases. From a modern biomedical perspective, generalized bloodletting lacks efficacy for most conditions and can be harmful; yet targeted phlebotomy retains therapeutic value in specific diseases such as hemochromatosis and polycythemia vera. The image thus documents both a historical standard of care and the long arc of evidence-based correction.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Urban crowding, sanitation, labor intensity, and famine cycles predisposed populations to infections and debility that bled patients were meant to relieve. Access to trained practitioners, gender norms around bodily exposure, and religious fasting shaped who was treated and how. Climate and housing quality influenced humoral “temperament,” while patronage networks and guild membership governed which therapies were available across class lines.
