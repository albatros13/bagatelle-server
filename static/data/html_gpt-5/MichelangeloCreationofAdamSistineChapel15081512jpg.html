    <div class="content">
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564) was an Italian artist of the High Renaissance, celebrated as a sculptor, painter, architect, and draftsman. Trained in Florence, he brought sculptural thinking—an intense focus on the human body and its expressive capacities—to all media. His familiarity with human anatomy, informed by firsthand dissections in his youth, shaped the muscular dynamism and anatomical fidelity that define the figures on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The Creation of Adam was frescoed between 1508 and 1512 for the Sistine Chapel in Rome under Pope Julius II. This was the apogee of the High Renaissance, a period marked by humanist learning, revived classical ideals, and papal ambitions to project authority through grand artistic commissions. Rome attracted leading artists and intellectuals, while reformist currents and political rivalries formed a charged cultural backdrop to biblical image-making of exceptional scale and ambition.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The scene depicts the biblical moment when God imparts life to Adam. The nearly touching hands compress the instant of animation into a charged visual metaphor: vitality and intellect transferred across a minuscule gap. Scholars have argued that the mantle enveloping God and the angels outlines a human brain, proposing that the fresco encodes a metaphor for the bestowal of intellect or consciousness (Meshberger, 1990). While debated, this neuroanatomical reading emphasizes the work’s engagement with human cognition as a divine gift.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo organizes the composition around two opposing diagonals—Adam’s reclining nude and God’s forward-rushing group—creating a dynamic interval at their fingertips. Idealized anatomy, sculptural volume, and foreshortening establish corporeal presence, while clear contours (disegno) and controlled color model form under fresco’s constraints. Negative space intensifies the anticipation of touch; rhythmic drapery around God accelerates motion, and Adam’s monumental stillness counterbalances it, articulating a visual dialectic of potential and act.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The Sistine ceiling was made possible by concentrated papal wealth and authority, resources unavailable to most artisans. Access to classical learning and to anatomical knowledge—often mediated by courts, universities, or religious institutions—was unequally distributed. While Michelangelo could study anatomy, many practitioners faced restrictions or lacked patrons. The fresco thus embodies both the flourishing of knowledge at elite centers and the structural inequities that governed who could participate in artistic and scientific innovation.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Reading the image through the brain-shaped mantle invites a biomedical discussion of cerebrovascular disease, especially ischemic stroke—the abrupt loss of neurologic function due to arterial occlusion. Most ischemic strokes arise from thromboembolic events: in-situ thrombosis within a cerebral artery, or emboli from the heart (for example, in atrial fibrillation) or proximal vessels. Atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking are major etiologic drivers that compromise vascular integrity and cerebral perfusion.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Ischemic stroke typically presents with sudden, focal deficits: unilateral weakness or numbness, facial droop, aphasia, dysarthria, visual field cuts, or ataxia. In cortical strokes, contralateral hemiparesis reflects injury to the precentral gyrus and corticospinal tracts; language dysfunction implies dominant-hemisphere involvement. The charged yet unclosed gap between the fingers in the fresco can serve as a modern heuristic for disrupted neuro-signaling—an imaginative analogy for a break in the chain from cortical intent to motor execution—even as the painting itself idealizes health.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Contemporary management prioritizes time-sensitive reperfusion: intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase or tenecteplase within recommended windows, and mechanical thrombectomy for eligible large-vessel occlusions. Secondary prevention targets risk factors through antiplatelet or anticoagulation strategies, statins, blood pressure and glucose control, and lifestyle modification. In Michelangelo’s day, Galenic humoral therapies—bloodletting, purgatives, dietetics—prevailed; anatomical precision existed, but evidence-based vascular neurology did not. The historical contrast underscores how anatomical curiosity ultimately set the stage for later scientific therapeutics.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Outcomes in stroke hinge on determinants beyond biology: proximity to stroke-ready hospitals, emergency transport times, insurance coverage, education, and the capacity to sustain prevention (medications, diet, safe spaces for activity). Environmental exposures and chronic stress linked to poverty or discrimination elevate vascular risk. Just as Renaissance patronage structured who accessed knowledge, modern health systems stratify access to acute reperfusion and rehabilitation, shaping differential morbidity and mortality across populations.</p>
