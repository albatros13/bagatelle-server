        <p><em>Caption: Artist Unknown Malayan Black Magic ilmu Sihir (19)</em></p>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>
        The sheet is attributable to an anonymous Malay scribe-artist working within the Islamicate manuscript culture of the Malay world. Such makers were frequently scholar-healers trained in pondok or surau schools, conversant in Jawi (Malay written in Arabic script) and in the talismanic sciences that circulated from the Middle East to island Southeast Asia. The “artist” here is best understood as a ritual technician who fused calligraphy, diagram, and medical-religious knowledge, producing an image intended to operate as both visual theology and therapeutic instrument.
        </p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>
        The 19th century Malay world—spanning the Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, and the Straits—was shaped by expanding colonial rule (British and Dutch), maritime trade, and Islamic renewal movements. Manuscript culture persisted alongside lithographic print, and healers navigated plural medical ecologies: humoral and prophetic medicine (tibb), local Austronesian concepts of wind/heat, and emerging colonial public health. Epidemics of smallpox, cholera, and malaria punctuated the century, while vaccination campaigns and quinine therapy arrived unevenly. In that cross-current, talismanic sheets and calligrams served as portable technologies of protection, diagnosis, and ritual healing within households and clinics of the bomoh/dukun.
        </p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>
        The figure formed from script is a calligram—a human outline animated by phrases in Arabic and Jawi. Comparable works often inscribe invocations, the Beautiful Names of God, Qur’anic healing verses, and protective formulae arranged to circulate around vulnerable anatomical sites. The encircling text operates apotropaically: enclosing the body within a field of sacred language to repel malign forces (sihr, hasad) and discipline unruly winds (angin). The diagrammatic pose, with accentuated limbs and torso, suggests a diagnostic map where zones of pain or fever could be named, touched, or washed with ink diluted into water for drinking, a well-attested practice in the region.
        </p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>
        Stylistically the sheet is economical: thin, unmodulated ink line articulates a walking figure; density comes from textual rhythm rather than shading. The contour is continuous, almost talismanic knotwork, while the inner fields host larger cartouches of text that balance negative space. Repetition and radial flow of script establish movement; contrast emerges between the abstract linear body and the legible word. As in Ottoman or Maghribi calligrams, form and text are coextensive; yet the handwriting and orthography are distinctly Malay in their Jawi ductus and local lexical choices. Function governs aesthetics: clarity of letters must survive handling, washing, and recitation.
        </p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>
        The artwork speaks to inequities in access to care under colonial economies that prioritized ports and plantations over rural interiors. Indigenous healers served communities excluded from fee-based hospitals or skeptical of foreign interventions. Gendered inequities were acute: postpartum disorders, spirit affliction, and infertility often fell under women’s ritual networks with limited biomedical attention. Literacy in Jawi could empower custodianship of such sheets, while non-literate users relied on specialists, reinforcing hierarchies of knowledge and payment. The stigmatization of mental illness likewise channeled sufferers toward ritual therapies when colonial psychiatry was punitive or distant.
        </p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>
        Sheets of this type were deployed for febrile illnesses and conditions conceptualized as intrusions—heat, wind, or spirits. Historically prevalent diseases in the Malay world included malaria (Plasmodium spp. via Anopheles), cholera (Vibrio cholerae through contaminated water), and smallpox (Variola virus). Local nosologies mapped these onto categories such as demam (fever) with subtypes, panas/dingin imbalance, or meroyan (postpartum disturbance). While etiologies are framed religiously—envy, sorcery, or jinn—the same objects might be used adjunctively with herbal decoctions or purgatives. Thus biomedical pathogens and moral-metaphysical causes coexisted in a pragmatic therapeutic repertoire.
        </p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>
        The image’s segmented limbs and torso function as a somatic register: inscriptions cluster where fever breaks (temples, chest), where cramps seize (forearms, calves), and along the abdomen for fluxes and choleraic diarrhea. Text that spirals outward from extremities metaphorically “drives out” illness. In humoral language, pallor, rigors, and dark urine would signal excess heat or corrupt blood; in biomedical terms, these align with malarial paroxysms, dehydration, and hemolysis. The act of tracing or washing the written word over a symptom site externalizes pain, offering cognitive framing and placebo-mediated relief while marking the body as sacred terrain.
        </p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>
        Treatment combined recitation (ruqyah), the wearing or bathing of inked verses, and materia medica: cooling herbs, ginger and galangal for wind, and Andrographis paniculata for fevers. By the late 19th century, quinine from cinchona bark was increasingly available against malaria; smallpox vaccination circulated through colonial and court networks; cholera management emphasized boiling water and oral rehydration (coconut water served empirically). The sheet would be activated through prayer, timed astrological hours, or smoke fumigation, then integrated with dietetic regimes that balanced panas/dingin. Its efficacy operated symbolically, socially, and—in cases of hygiene advice—practically.
        </p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>
        Disease patterns were driven by ecology (mangrove swamps fostering mosquitoes), trade and pilgrimage routes, seasonal monsoon flows, housing density in riverine towns, and poverty limiting access to clean water. Education level shaped acceptance of vaccination and knowledge of boiling or latrine use. Labor regimes on estates intensified exposure and malnutrition, while displacement during conflicts undermined continuity of care. Religious institutions provided mutual aid and healing networks, with talismanic images mediating between scriptural authority and community need.
