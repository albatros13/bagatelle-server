        <h1>The medicine of Akbar — attributed to Muhammad Akbar Arzani (c. 1722)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Muhammad Akbar ibn Muhammad Ali Arzani (d. 1721/22) was a Persian physician who worked in Mughal India and wrote in Persian within the Greco‑Arabic (Unani) medical tradition. His compendia, notably Tibb‑i Akbar and Mizan al‑Tibb, synthesized Galenic‑Avicennian doctrine with South Asian materia medica. The image belongs to the Persianate manuscript culture that paired didactic texts with diagrammatic miniatures for students and practitioners.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Early eighteenth‑century Mughal India was a cosmopolitan, Persian‑speaking intellectual world linking Iran, Central Asia, and South Asia. Medical learning circulated in madrasa, private libraries, and courtly ateliers; manuscript production persisted even as printed European anatomical images began to trickle in through Jesuit, Armenian, and Dutch intermediaries. Dissection was rare and often taboo, so anatomy was taught through texts, schematic drawings, and animal analogy. Unani physicians collaborated and competed with Ayurvedic vaidyas, sharing drugs, diagnostic categories, and therapeutic regimens in a plural medical marketplace.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The standing, semi‑frontal figure with opened torso is a didactic “cutaway” rather than an autoptic portrait. The heart, liver, and other viscera are rendered both in situ and as floating vignettes labeled in Persian script, a convention that emphasizes their names and functions over lifelike placement. Chromatic cues echo humoral associations: red for sanguine heat, yellow‑green for bile, dusky tones for melancholic dryness. The uterus with a curled fetus signals obstetric pedagogy; the sprig of botanicals alludes to pharmacology and the therapeutic garden central to Unani materia medica.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Stylistically, the work merges miniature‑painting conventions—flat planes, strong contour lines, and restrained modeling—with diagrammatic clarity. Hieratic scale privileges key organs; negative space isolates marginal organ studies; and calligraphic annotations function as both text and ornament. The limited palette and burnished paper ground produce legibility rather than verisimilitude. Rhythm is created by repeated oval forms of viscera, while balance is maintained by the figure’s contrapposto and the echoed organ studies around the margins.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The image’s focus on pregnancy evokes gendered inequities in health. Access to trained practitioners varied by class, caste, and region; many women relied on local midwives (dais) whose expertise was substantial but unevenly connected to courtly or scholarly medicine. Purdah and seclusion shaped clinical encounters, often restricting examination. Manuscripts like this circulated among elites, reinforcing educational hierarchies even as they informed practitioners serving broader publics.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Although not depicting a specific case, the illustration addresses reproductive anatomy—an arena historically associated with maternal morbidity. In Unani nosology, disease arose from deranged temperament (suʾ‑i mizaj) and humoral imbalance (akhlat) leading to congestion (imtilaʾ) or obstruction. Obstetric disorders were framed as disruptions of uterine heat and moisture or impediments to the fetus’s correct orientation. From a modern biomedical perspective, leading causes of maternal illness include hemorrhage, sepsis, hypertensive disorders (preeclampsia/eclampsia), and obstructed labor—conditions that nineteenth‑ and twentieth‑century anatomy and obstetrics would anatomically localize with greater precision.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Unani texts described prodromes such as palpitations, dizziness, and altered complexion (interpreted through humoral color theory), as well as obstetric signs like prolonged labor, malpresentation, or foul lochia suggestive of puerperal infection. The schematic fetus here signals the pedagogical problem of presentation and delivery mechanics. The separately depicted heart reflects awareness of cardiocentric symptom clusters—palpitations, dyspnea, and syncope—linked in humoral theory to heat and vapors, and in modern terms to anemia or cardiomyopathy that can complicate pregnancy.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Therapy in the Unani regimen emphasized adjustment of the six non‑naturals (air, food and drink, sleep and wakefulness, motion and rest, evacuation and retention, emotions), dietetic prescriptions, compound simples (e.g., fennel, asafetida, myrobalan), cupping, fomentations, and, when indicated, phlebotomy. Obstetric management included lubricants, gentle traction, and herbal parturifacients, with dais performing manual maneuvers. Contemporary evidence‑based care contrasts but also echoes these aims: antenatal risk screening; active management of the third stage with uterotonics (oxytocin); antibiotics for sepsis; antihypertensives and magnesium sulfate for preeclampsia; timely operative delivery; and iron/folate to address anemia. Both frameworks seek balance—of humors in Unani, of physiologic parameters in modern obstetrics—though their explanatory models differ.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Maternal outcomes are powerfully shaped by nutrition, sanitation, literacy, autonomy in household decision‑making, cost and distance to care, and legal frameworks around childbirth attendance. Historical constraints—limited cadaveric study, manuscript access, and gendered norms—intersected with these determinants. Today, similar gradients persist: rural residence, poverty, discrimination, and weak health systems predict higher risk. The image, didactic and portable, stands at the nexus of knowledge transmission and the inequalities that govern who can act upon that knowledge.</p>
