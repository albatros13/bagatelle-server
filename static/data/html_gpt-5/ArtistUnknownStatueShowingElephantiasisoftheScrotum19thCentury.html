        <h1>Statue Showing Elephantiasis of the Scrotum (19th century)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            The artist is unknown. Formal traits—cast metal, stylized facial features, and an emphasis on conceptual over naturalistic proportion—resonate with broader West African brasscasting practices that used the lost‑wax method, in which a wax model is encased in clay, the wax melted out, and molten metal poured in. In several West African centers, casting was historically maintained by hereditary guilds associated with courts, ritual specialists, or market towns. Although precise cultural attribution cannot be asserted here, the work clearly participates in a regional tradition where sculpture served didactic, commemorative, and devotional functions rather than purely mimetic ones [6,7].
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            Dated to the 19th century, the statue emerges from a period marked by intensified intra‑African trade, coastal encounters with Europeans, missionary and medical incursions, and shifting political formations. In many parts of tropical Africa, artists and healers collaborated: figural objects could be commissioned to mark unusual bodily states or to channel protective forces. Concurrently, lymphatic filariasis—the disease most often causing scrotal elephantiasis—was endemic in humid, mosquito‑rich ecologies shaped by settlement density, agriculture, and water management [1,2]. Such artworks register the coexistence of ritual medicine and emerging biomedical knowledge in a colonial contact zone.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
            The figure sits with legs spread to frame a dramatically enlarged scrotum—the iconographic center. The gesture makes the pathology unmissable, converting a private affliction into a public sign. The object held in one hand, read as a ladle or spoon, plausibly signifies offering, healing, or ingestion of remedies. Enlarged eyes and patterned coiffure intensify presence; amuletic strands across the torso may allude to protective medicines. The piece thus oscillates between documentation and efficacy: it can both depict illness and serve as a mediating device in appeals to ancestors or deities for cure.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            Proportion is purposeful, not descriptive: head and scrotum are exaggerated to convey status (mind, sight) and condition (disease). Rhythmic surface tooling and a warm patina relay the tactile qualities of cast metal. The seated, triangular base formed by the legs provides stability, while asymmetries in the arms activate the silhouette. Emphasis, contrast, and scale operate as primary principles; selective detailing (facial features, jewelry) counters the otherwise schematic torso, a common strategy in figurative casts from the region [6,7].
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            Genital elephantiasis disproportionately affects men in low‑resource settings where vector exposure is high and health access is limited. In the 19th century, coerced labor, conflict, and colonial extraction compounded vulnerability by disrupting sanitation and housing. Stigma attached to genital deformity could threaten marriage prospects, fertility expectations, and social standing. Such inequities—then and now—shape not only who becomes ill but also who is represented in art and how illness is interpreted within moral and spiritual frameworks [1,4].
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            The most common biomedical cause of scrotal elephantiasis in Africa is lymphatic filariasis due to Wuchereria bancrofti, a parasitic nematode transmitted by mosquitoes (including Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes). Infective larvae enter during mosquito feeding, mature in lymphatic vessels, and provoke lymph dilation, valve damage, and chronic inflammation. Over years, impaired lymph drainage leads to lymphedema, hydrocele, and tissue fibrosis. Episodes of acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (bacterial superinfection) accelerate progression [1–3].
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Clinically, scrotal elephantiasis presents with massive enlargement, skin thickening, papillary changes, and in advanced cases a lobulated, pendulous mass. Hydrocele—fluid accumulation within the tunica vaginalis—often coexists and may be primary in bancroftian filariasis. The statue’s exaggerated scrotum, contrasted with relatively slender limbs, visually isolates the key diagnostic sign. The taut posture and forward tilt intensify a sense of weight and discomfort, effectively communicating morbidity without anatomical literalism.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Public health control relies on annual mass drug administration to interrupt transmission: combinations of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) with albendazole, or ivermectin with albendazole in onchocerciasis‑coendemic areas, and in some settings a single‑dose triple therapy (ivermectin‑DEC‑albendazole) [1,5]. For individuals with chronic lymphedema, essential care includes hygiene, skin care, management of acute attacks, exercise, and elevation; doxycycline targeting Wolbachia endosymbionts can reduce pathology in selected cases [2,3]. Hydrocele is most effectively treated by surgery. Vector control—long‑lasting insecticidal nets and environmental management—complements chemotherapy [1,2].
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Risk is patterned by poverty, occupation (nighttime outdoor work), housing quality, proximity to mosquito breeding sites, and access to clean water and healthcare. Education and stigma mitigation are pivotal, as shame can delay care‑seeking. Climate variability influences vector ecology, while urban growth without infrastructure can intensify exposure. Addressing these determinants aligns with contemporary elimination strategies that integrate MDA, morbidity management, and equitable health systems strengthening [1,4,5].
