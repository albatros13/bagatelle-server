        <h1>Phaedra and Hippolytus, Roman marble (ca. 290 CE)</h1>

        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
        Produced by an anonymous Roman workshop, likely part of the thriving metropolitan sarcophagus industry around Rome in the late third century CE. Such ateliers specialized in mythological reliefs carved by teams of artisans—block roughers, drill specialists, and finishers—who adapted Greek tragic subjects to Roman funerary needs. The “authorship” is therefore collective, grounded in workshop templates and iconographic repertoires rather than a single named master.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
        Dated to about 290 CE, this relief belongs to a period when myth-laden sarcophagi articulated elite Roman identities during mounting political instability. The late imperial era saw a taste for densely populated narratives that moralized passions and fate. Educated patrons valued Greek paideia; Euripidean and Senecan tragedy offered exemplary tales of self-control, divine retribution, and the dangers of unchecked desire—motifs resonant in commemorating the dead and instructing the living.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
        The scene dramatizes the myth of Phaedra’s illicit desire for her stepson Hippolytus. Typical elements appear: a veiled, seated woman (Phaedra) in pudicitia pose, attended by a nurse; Eros (Cupid) intrudes as the personified force of passion; Hippolytus stands youthful and semi-nude with hunting attributes, often accompanied by a dog and the head or presence of a horse, alluding to Artemisian chastity and the fatal chariot wreck. Bearded elders or attendants may signify tutors or Theseus, the patriarchal arbiter. The composition encodes causation (Eros), transgression (stepmother’s desire), and consequence (Hippolytus’s doom), turning a household drama into a moral tableau.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
        The carvers exploit deep drilling and crisp undercutting to animate drapery, hair, and spatial layering. Figures are tightly packed in a continuous frieze, their gestures creating a rhythmic chain of glances and pointing hands that “read” like theater. Contrapposto, fluttering drapery, and expressive faces guide narrative emphasis. The relief balances classical naturalism with late antique frontality: idealized anatomy coexists with emphatic, almost diagrammatic gesture, clarifying the story for viewers moving laterally along the sarcophagus.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
        The myth foregrounds gendered power and the precarious position of women in elite households. Phaedra’s nurse—likely enslaved—mediates desire and secrecy, signaling labor and status hierarchies. The honor code privileges male lineage and reputation; the woman’s passion threatens civic order and is judged harshly. The stepson’s virtue (chastity, devotion to Artemis) is valorized over Phaedra’s constrained agency, reflecting patriarchy’s moral asymmetries and the stigma attached to female sexuality and mental distress.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
        Ancient medicine construed eros as a disease of the soul-body continuum. In Hippocratic and Galenic frameworks, intense desire disturbed the pneuma and humors, heating and drying the body, exciting the heart, and deranging judgment. Philosophers and physicians labeled such states mania, melancholia, or lovesickness (amor hereos in later Latin). Tragedy adds divine etiology: Aphrodite inflicts passion as punishment, externalizing causality. The artwork fuses both: Cupid functions like an etiological agent, while Phaedra’s posture advertises a psychosomatic crisis rooted in bodily and moral imbalance.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
        Visual medicine operates through gesture: Phaedra’s averted gaze, slackened limbs, and supported body evoke lassitude, withdrawal, and the “shame-fast” stance associated with illness and ethical collapse. The nurse’s urgent hand signals diagnosis and counsel. Cupid’s proximity literalizes pathogenesis. The dog and horse, symbols of Hippolytus’s outdoorsy regimen, contrast with Phaedra’s interior seclusion—an ancient differential between healthy motion and diseased stasis. While marble cannot show pallor or pulse, the sculptor encodes canonical symptoms—insomnia, anorexia, chest constriction, and ruminative fixation—through narrative compression and bodily rhetoric.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment<br>
        Ancient therapeutics for eros combined regimen and moral therapy: cooling diets, baths, moderation of wine, music, and supervised exercise to temper heated humors; distraction through hunting or travel; and philosophical therapy to reframe passions. Religious recourse—votive offerings to Aphrodite or Artemis, incubation in Asclepian sanctuaries—sought divine correction. Literary exempla (e.g., the physician Erasistratus diagnosing lovesickness by pulse changes in Antiochus) underline diagnostic craft. Tragedy, however, warns that without confession, counsel, and separation from the stimulus, the condition may escalate to delusion, slander, and self-destruction.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
        Household architecture (female seclusion), reputation economies, and the legal authority of the paterfamilias shaped both onset and management of Phaedra’s disorder. Silence enforced by shame, dependence on servile intermediaries, and fear of dishonor curtailed early intervention. Gendered expectations around chastity and obedience intensified cognitive dissonance, while mythic divine agency normalized fatalism over care. The relief thus visualizes how social structure, not merely physiology, drives the trajectory from desire to catastrophe.</p>
