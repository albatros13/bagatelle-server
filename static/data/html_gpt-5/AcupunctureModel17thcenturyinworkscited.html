<h1>Acupuncture Model (17th century)</h1>

<h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
<p>
This work is attributed to anonymous artisan-physicians trained in East Asian medical traditions. Such models were typically produced in workshops linked to medical academies or court-sponsored practitioners, where craft specialists collaborated with doctors to incise and label meridians and acupoints. The object embodies a collective authorship: the accumulated knowledge of scholars, clinicians, and craftspeople who standardized acupoint locations through didactic objects, manuals, and examinations.
</p>

<h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
<p>
In the 17th century—spanning late Ming/early Qing China and the Edo period in Japan—acupuncture and moxibustion were central to daily healthcare. Models descended from the famous Song-dynasty “bronze men” used for licensing examinations. By the 1600s, increased woodblock publishing, transregional trade, and scholarly exchange fostered new atlases and teaching aids. In Japan, guild structures and medical academies regulated practice, while in China, lineage-based instruction and court medicine preserved canonical texts. This model functioned within that pedagogical and regulatory ecosystem.
</p>

<h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
<p>
The incised lines trace meridians (jingluo), conceptual pathways that coordinate organ networks. Dots or tiny inscriptions mark acupoints—sites for therapeutic intervention—evoking a cartography of the body where circulation of qi and blood is both physiological and cosmological. The upright stance and exposed surface invite touch, measurement, and memory; many historical models were hollow and could be coated and tested in examinations, symbolizing the idealized, normative body. The figure’s proportional canons and frontality encode a universalized patient, a template rather than an individual portrait.
</p>

<h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
<p>
Formally, the model balances verisimilitude with abstraction. The simplified facial features and elongated limbs create clear fields for linear incision, while rhythmic, parallel line-work organizes visual flow along limbs and trunk. Contrast between smooth ground and darkened incisions enhances legibility, a didactic use of value. Proportion adheres to medical measurement units (cun) rather than strict Western anatomical realism, foregrounding functional clarity over mimetic detail. The result is a diagrammatic sculpture where line is the primary expressive element, translating text into three dimensions.
</p>

<h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
<p>
Access to training and care varied by gender, class, and disability. In Tokugawa Japan, blind practitioners formed organized guilds that achieved status yet also faced legal restrictions and economic precarity. Women’s participation in formal medical institutions was limited, despite their central roles in household healing. Colonial and later biomedical hegemonies in the 19th–20th centuries marginalized traditional practitioners, producing uneven recognition and reimbursement that persist today. The model thus indexes both community empowerment through shared knowledge and exclusion through credentialing and regulation.
</p>

<h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
<p>
The model primarily teaches conditions conceptualized as disruptions of qi and blood—painful obstruction (bi), digestive and respiratory disorders, gynecological complaints, and post-illness weakness. From a biomedical standpoint, many indications now studied include chronic musculoskeletal pain, tension-type headache, migraine prophylaxis, postoperative nausea, and osteoarthritis. Etiologies range from peripheral nociception and inflammatory mediators to central sensitization and dysregulated pain modulation. Acupuncture is hypothesized to influence endogenous opioids, descending inhibitory pathways, autonomic balance, and connective tissue signaling.
</p>

<h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
<p>
In traditional diagnostics, tenderness along meridians, altered pulse qualities, and localized nodules guide point selection; the model encodes these pathways and decision nodes. Modern correlates include overlap between acupoints and myofascial trigger points, cutaneous nerve branches, and intermuscular fascial planes. Neuroimaging studies report modulation of limbic and sensorimotor networks during needling, while histological work suggests fibroblast mechanotransduction at needle sites. The visual density of points at joints and paraspinal regions reflects clinical salience for musculoskeletal pain.
</p>

<h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
<p>
Historically, treatment entails precise point location by proportional measurement, needle insertion to elicit deqi (a characteristic sensation), and adjunct moxibustion or manual techniques. Contemporary protocols for chronic pain use standardized and individualized point sets over multiple sessions. Evidence from meta-analyses indicates modest but clinically meaningful benefits for chronic pain and headache prevention, with safety contingent on sterile technique and trained practitioners. Integration with exercise, education, and behavioral therapies is common; contraindications and rare adverse events (e.g., pneumothorax) underscore the need for credentialed care.
</p>

<h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
<p>
Outcomes are shaped by access to trained practitioners, coverage and cost, cultural health beliefs, occupational strain, and comorbid stress. Urban centers may offer dense networks of care, while rural settings face shortages. Health literacy influences adherence to course-based therapy. Historical inequities in professional recognition affect present-day reimbursement and research funding, perpetuating disparities in who benefits from complementary pain management options.
