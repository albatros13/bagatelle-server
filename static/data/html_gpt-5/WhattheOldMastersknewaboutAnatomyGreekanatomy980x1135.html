        <h1>What the Old Masters Knew about Anatomy: Greek Anatomy</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The work depicts Perseus triumphantly displaying the head of Medusa, a subject rooted in classical Greek mythology and widely treated by sculptors from antiquity through the Neoclassical period. Whether ancient or a later revival, the sculpture belongs to the Greco-Roman tradition that prized the ideal male body as a measure of civic virtue. The figure’s athletic nudity, winged helmet, and sword link it to the artistic lineage of Greek workshops inspired by masters such as Polykleitos, whose proportional “canon” shaped the representation of heroic anatomy for centuries.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        In classical Greece (5th–4th centuries BCE), sculpture served not only religious and commemorative functions but also articulated philosophical ideals of balance and reason. The heroic nude crystallized the polis’s values: moderation, discipline, and bodily excellence. Hellenistic innovations (3rd–1st centuries BCE) then amplified movement and psychological drama. Later, Renaissance and Neoclassical artists revived these ideals, informed by antiquarian study and, importantly, the period’s renewed anatomical investigations. Parallel to the visual arts, Greek medicine developed from Hippocratic naturalism to Hellenistic anatomical research at Alexandria, where Herophilus and Erasistratus advanced dissection-based knowledge, forming a scientific backdrop to the sculptural celebration of the body.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        Perseus functions as a paradigm of rational courage overcoming monstrous chaos. The Gorgoneion—the severed head of Medusa—was an apotropaic emblem believed to avert evil; its display here dramatizes the hero’s mastery of fear and death. The winged helmet alludes to divine assistance and swift resolve. The sword and drapery create a narrative of action and aftermath: violence arrested at the moment of victory. In Greek civic terms, the scene encodes ethical instruction: virtù and sophrosyne (self-control) subdue destructive forces, just as the ordered proportions of the body subdue disorder in form.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        The figure assumes contrapposto: weight rests on one leg, the other relaxed, generating an elegant S-curve and chiastic balance between tensed and relaxed limbs. Proportion adheres to a classical canon—head-to-body ratios and measured muscle groups produce an idealized, not literal, anatomy. Surface finish smooths skin to marble luminosity while sharpening edges at the sword and hair to heighten contrast. Negative space between outstretched arm and torso punctuates the gesture, directing the viewer’s gaze from the hero’s profile to the trophy head. Rhythm, symmetry with variation, and clarity of silhouette ensure legibility from multiple viewpoints.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        The idealized male citizen body excludes many: women, enslaved people, foreigners, and laborers whose bodies were not publicly celebrated. Access to training in the gymnasion and to medical care reflected status and wealth. The normalization of the able, athletic male body functions as an aesthetic of power, naturalizing civic hierarchies and sidelining experiences of disability or illness that were common in ancient life but seldom monumentalized.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        While mythic, the imagery intersects with ancient medical concerns. Decapitation represents catastrophic trauma leading to rapid exsanguination and loss of cerebral perfusion—unsurvivable without modern intervention. The Medusa myth, whose gaze “petrifies,” can be read as an ancient metaphor for paralysis or catatonia, conditions that immobilize and “stone” the body. The serpentine hair evokes fears of envenomation, a genuine Mediterranean hazard; Greek physicians understood snakebite as a toxic corruption of humors, causing swelling, necrosis, and systemic collapse. The artwork, thus, condenses threats—violence, paralysis, poison—over which heroic order asserts mastery.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        The lifeless head exhibits slack facial musculature and open mouth, conventional markers of death in sculpture. The hero’s vascular and muscular clarity—idealized but carefully articulated deltoids, pectorals, and obliques—reflect artists’ close observation of living anatomy and cadaveric study in later eras. The stark contrast between animated, balanced body and the inert, disordered visage signals the visual codes by which antiquity and its revivals communicated vitality versus pathology.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        For traumatic decapitation, no ancient treatment exists; the scene is absolute victory and irreversible loss. In real ancient practice, Greek physicians treated severe wounds with ligatures, cautery, wine or vinegar irrigation, and bandaging described in the Hippocratic Corpus. For snakebite, recommendations included incision and suction, cautery, tourniquets proximal to the bite, and plant-based pharmaka; later authors systematized antidotes, though efficacy varied. Cult healing at Asclepieia complemented rational methods, combining incubation dreams, diet, and exercise—an integrated regimen addressing body and psyche.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Outcomes in antiquity depended on status, proximity to physicians or sanctuaries, and the capacity to rest and procure diet and drugs. Soldiers and athletes incurred specific risks but also enjoyed institutional care. Enslaved people and the poor faced environmental hazards, crowding, and limited agency to seek treatment. Gender norms restricted women’s access to male physicians in some contexts, shaping pathways of care. The sculpture’s perfected body, therefore, contrasts with the uneven realities of health in the societies that produced and later revived such images.
