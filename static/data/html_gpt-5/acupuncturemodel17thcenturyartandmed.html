    <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
    Attributed to an East Asian medical workshop, most likely Chinese and associated with late Ming to early Qing professional practice. Such models, known generically as acupuncture figures (tongren), were produced by craftsmen working closely with physicians who followed classical doctrines derived from the Huangdi Neijing. Comparable exemplars appear in Chinese and, later, Japanese (Edo-period) contexts, reflecting artisanal collaboration between woodcarvers, painters, and literati-physicians who standardized point locations for teaching and examination.</p>

    <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
    Seventeenth-century East Asia experienced intense medical systematization, commercial print expansion, and growing urban clinics. In China, state examinations for physicians were sporadic, but canonical learning thrived through commentaries and case records. Bronze models created under Wang Weiyi in the Song (11th century) provided precedent; by the 17th century wood and lacquered figures circulated in academies and private practices. Global exchanges via Jesuit and Dutch networks brought these objects to European curiosity cabinets, where they mediated early cross-cultural understandings of anatomy and therapeutics. The figure embodies both pedagogical precision and the sociability of learned medicine in a period of political change and marketized healing.</p>

    <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
    The inscribed meridian lines map the body as a microcosm threaded by qi pathways that link exterior and interior. Iconographically, the figure’s frontal stance and exposed orifices signal the clinical surface upon which invisible flows are made visible. The named points (often numbered in later editions) encode correspondences among zangfu organ systems, the five phases, and seasonal rhythms. The standardized male physique is itself symbolic: a neutral template for teaching, abstracted from individual difference, yet loaded with cosmological meaning where illness appears as blockage, deficiency, or disharmony rather than isolated lesion.</p>

    <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
    Carved in proportionate realism, the model uses linear patterning to create visual rhythm; meridians act as contour lines that both describe and traverse form. Repetition of short hatch marks indicates point loci, punctuating the surface with a measured cadence. The restrained palette—dark lines against a warm wooden ground—prioritizes legibility over ornament. Balance is frontal and symmetrical, echoing didactic diagrams. Texture shifts between smoothed planes and incised notations, enhancing tactile comprehension for students rotating the object in space.</p>

    <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
    Access to literate medical lineages and models like this skewed toward urban, male practitioners and elite patients. Female bodies were often treated via gender-segregated practices; female models existed but were rarer, mirroring unequal visibility. In colonial and modern global contexts, acupuncture faced both exoticization and regulatory marginalization, influencing who could practice and who could afford integrative care. The object thus indexes hierarchies of education, gendered modesty, and later Orientalist collecting that displaced artifacts from their clinical communities.</p>

    <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
    Representative condition: chronic low back pain. In classical terms, etiologies include wind-cold-damp “bi” obstruction in the taiyang (Bladder) channel, qi and blood stagnation from overexertion or trauma, and kidney deficiency patterns with aging. Biomedically, chronic low back pain encompasses degenerative disc disease, facet arthropathy, myofascial trigger points, and neuropathic components; multifactorial causes include mechanical load, sedentary behavior, and psychosocial stress. The model operates as a 3D atlas to select points addressing both local nociceptive sources and systemic regulatory mechanisms.</p>

    <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
    On this iconographic surface, relevant pathways include the Bladder channel coursing paraspinally and the Governor Vessel along the midline—lines that visually cue palpation zones. Traditional signs might include stiffness aggravated by cold, limited flexion, and a choppy or wiry pulse; biomedical signs include paraspinal tenderness, reduced range of motion, positive facet-loading maneuvers, or radicular symptoms if nerve roots are irritated. The figure’s meridian grid transforms subjective pain into a mappable, repeatable set of loci enabling shared diagnostic language.</p>

    <p>[h] Treatment<br>
    Acupuncture strategies for chronic low back pain commonly combine local and distal points: BL23 (Shenshu), BL25 (Dachangshu), BL40 (Weizhong), DU3–DU4, GB30 (Huantiao), with individualized selections such as KI3 or SI3. Techniques may include manual stimulation, electroacupuncture, and heat (moxibustion). Contemporary evidence—meta-analyses and comparative effectiveness reviews—supports modest-to-moderate benefits over usual care and sham for chronic pain outcomes, with low rates of serious adverse events when performed by trained practitioners. Treatment is often multimodal, integrating exercise therapy and education for durable improvement.</p>

    <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
    Occupational strain, income insecurity, and limited access to preventive care elevate chronic pain risk and constrain treatment choices. Cultural beliefs shape help-seeking; trust in traditional modalities can increase adherence, while insurance coverage and licensure laws affect availability. Environmental cold and damp housing correlate with symptom flares in traditional nosology and mirror biomedical links between stress, sleep quality, and pain persistence. The model’s portability once widened access to instruction; today, equitable pain care similarly depends on training distribution, language access, and cost.</p>
