<h1>Om Sep Fig (2018 14731 1024)</h1>

<p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe
This composite brings together European artworks from different centuries: a late nineteenth‑century Norwegian work by Edvard Munch, a seventeenth‑century Dutch portrait by Rembrandt, an early nineteenth‑century British medical image from the Wellcome tradition of didactic portraiture, and a sixteenth‑century head study by Hans Holbein. Though stylistically diverse, the images share a documentary impulse, registering bodily signs that later commentators have associated with syphilis and, in two cases, congenital transmission. The artists’ positions range from the introspective Expressionism of Munch to the sober naturalism of Dutch Baroque, the clinical clarity of medical art, and the incisive draughtsmanship of the Northern Renaissance.</p>

<p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)
Syphilis reshaped European medical and moral discourse from the sixteenth century onward. In Holbein’s era, the disease was both feared and moralized; depictions of blemished faces could serve as warnings in a culture that linked bodily appearance to virtue. By the Dutch Golden Age, portraiture prized physiognomic specificity, and viewers expected truthful record of sitters, including visible infirmity. The nineteenth century added scientific illustration and public health anxieties: medical atlases and hospital collections circulated images of advanced lesions, while Munch’s fin‑de‑siècle scene of mother and infant registers a modern, social‑medical drama in which inherited illness intersects with poverty, shame, and caregiving.</p>

<p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography
Munch’s mother‑and‑child motif is iconographically inverted: the tender Madonna archetype is recast as a clinical tableau of congenital disease. The infant’s pallor and mottling, set against a muted interior, symbolize the intrusion of pathology into domestic life. In the Dutch portrait, attributes such as gloves, paper, and costume articulate status, yet the face’s asymmetries and ocular changes—read by later viewers as stigmata—quietly destabilize ideals of prosperity and health. The medical painting’s centralized nasal destruction functions as a memento morbi, an icon of late-stage tissue loss. Holbein’s study, with its granular attention to skin, displaces heroism with corporeal scrutiny, inviting diagnostic as well as aesthetic readings.</p>

<p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)
Chiaroscuro dominates the Rembrandt, modeling the head in warm shadow and isolating the visage for close inspection. The slow paint handling fosters empathy while refusing cosmetic correction. Munch’s flattened planes, abrupt color contrasts, and off‑kilter composition are hallmarks of Symbolist‑Expressionist form-making, amplifying psychological unease. The medical image uses frontal lighting, tight framing, and descriptive brushwork to maximize legibility of lesions—an informational aesthetic. Holbein’s linear economy, silvery tonal range, and exacting contours exemplify Northern Renaissance draftsmanship; the economy of means heightens the salience of each papule and pit.</p>

<p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities
Across centuries, syphilis became entangled with stigma mapping onto class, gender, and sexuality. Women—especially those with limited access to prenatal care—bore disproportionate blame for congenital transmission. Urban poverty intensified exposure risks while constraining treatment. The artworks register these inequities: domestic interiors coded as modest, unidealized sitters, and images produced for medical audiences that often anonymized subjects while fixing their bodies as case material.</p>

<p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology
Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Primary infection arises at inoculation sites after sexual transmission. Hematogenous spread produces secondary manifestations; untreated infection may enter a latent stage and later develop gummatous, cardiovascular, or neurologic complications. Congenital syphilis results from transplacental transmission, most commonly during untreated or inadequately treated maternal infection, though transmission can occur at any stage. Fetal infection causes miscarriage, stillbirth, or live birth with early or late stigmata depending on timing and adequacy of maternal treatment.</p>

<p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness
Art historians and clinicians note visual correlates in these images: nasal bridge collapse and perforation consistent with gummatous destruction; rhagades at the mouth; periocular changes; and, in congenital cases, pallor, failure to thrive, and rashes. Late congenital signs may include saddle‑nose deformity, Hutchinson teeth, interstitial keratitis, sensorineural hearing loss, frontal bossing, and saber shins. The interpretive caution is crucial: artists select, stylize, or symbolically charge features; nevertheless, repeated motifs of nasal collapse, cutaneous papules, and ocular involvement mirror well-described clinical patterns.</p>

<p>[h] Treatment
Historically, therapies included mercury inunctions and fumigations and the early modern “guaiacum cure,” all with limited efficacy and high toxicity. The early twentieth century introduced arsphenamine (Salvarsan), followed by the transformative advent of penicillin. Today, benzathine penicillin G is first-line for uncomplicated syphilis; aqueous crystalline penicillin G is used for neurosyphilis and congenital disease. For pregnant patients with penicillin allergy, desensitization is recommended because alternatives are inadequate for preventing vertical transmission. Public health strategies—universal screening in pregnancy, timely treatment, and partner services—are essential to prevent congenital cases.</p>

<p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness
Persistence of congenital syphilis correlates with structural barriers: limited prenatal care access, unstable housing, substance use environments, incarceration, and inadequate insurance coverage. Stigma and mistrust of health systems delay testing and treatment; criminalization and moralizing narratives disincentivize care-seeking. Culturally safe services, point‑of‑care testing, expedited partner therapy where permitted, and integrated maternal‑child health programs are evidence-based measures that address these determinants.</p>
