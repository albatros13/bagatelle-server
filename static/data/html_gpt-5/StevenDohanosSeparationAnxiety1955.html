        <h1>Steven Dohanos Separation Anxiety (1955)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Steven Dohanos was a leading American illustrator associated with the golden age of magazine illustration. Best known for his covers for The Saturday Evening Post, he combined documentary observation with gentle satire, rendering everyday American life with crisp draftsmanship and lively color. His work aligned with a realist tradition that includes artists such as Norman Rockwell, yet Dohanos often favored ensemble scenes that foregrounded social spaces—post offices, barbershops, and, here, a pediatric waiting room.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted in 1955, the scene reflects postwar America during the Baby Boom, when pediatric offices were crowded and public health campaigns focused on infectious diseases. That year the Salk inactivated polio vaccine was announced as “safe, effective, and potent,” catalyzing mass immunization. The composition captures anxieties around childhood medical care at a moment when science was visibly reshaping family life and national optimism coexisted with fear of epidemic disease.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The toys strewn across the floor, picture books, and tiny shoes evoke childhood domesticity displaced into a clinical setting. The nurse’s white uniform and the physician framed by the doorway function as icons of biomedical authority. The central child clinging to the caregiver literalizes the title’s “separation anxiety,” while posters and diplomas on the wall symbolize institutional legitimacy. The open doorway works as a threshold between play and procedure, safety and exposure—an image of transition that turns the waiting room into a ritual space.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Dohanos uses a triangulated composition: foreground clustering of mothers and children, a mid-ground corridor, and a background treatment room. The chromatic scheme alternates cool greens and blues with warm flesh tones and toy primaries, guiding the eye through narrative vignettes. Linear precision and controlled perspective produce legibility akin to documentary photography, while rhythmic repetition—chairs, toys, small figures—creates visual tempo that mirrors the serial nature of office visits.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The scene centers a tidy, middle-class environment with conventional gender roles: women as caregivers, a male physician as expert. In 1955, access to pediatric care and the new polio vaccine was uneven, affected by segregation, household income, insurance coverage, and geography. The absence of visible diversity points to broader representational gaps and to historical realities of exclusion from clinics, clinical trials, and health communication campaigns.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While the artwork does not depict a specific pathogen, it evokes two biomedical topics: pediatric separation anxiety and vaccination against infectious disease. Developmentally, separation anxiety is common in preschool-aged children; in pathological form (Separation Anxiety Disorder) it manifests as excessive, developmentally inappropriate distress with anticipatory worry, somatic complaints, and impairment. Etiology involves attachment dynamics, parental anxiety modeling, recent stressors, and neurobiological stress reactivity (hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis).</p>
        <p>Concurrently, the 1955 clinical context foregrounds polio, measles, and pertussis—illnesses targeted by expanding immunization schedules. Vaccines work by presenting antigens that stimulate adaptive immunity, generating memory B and T cells that confer future protection without the risks of natural infection.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Visual cues—clinging, crying, avertive gaze, and bodily tension—signify acute anxiety. Behavioral markers include proximity seeking, refusal to separate, and scanning toward the treatment room. These are not signs of toxic illness but of stress arousal, potentially accompanied by sympathetic activation (tachycardia, sweating) and cortisol release. In the public health register, posters, vials, and white coats signal an environment designed for prevention, where absence of overt disease is itself a success narrative of mid-century medicine.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>For normative separation distress, evidence-supported strategies include gradual exposure, caregiver warmth with firm predictability, and preparation rituals (explaining steps, rehearsal play). Where impairment persists, cognitive-behavioral therapy with parent training demonstrates efficacy; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be considered for severe cases. Procedural distress during injections can be reduced by topical anesthetics, distraction, positioning for comfort, sucrose for infants, and trauma-informed communication. The biomedical counterpart—immunization—follows schedules validated by randomized trials and post-marketing surveillance to balance individual protection and herd immunity.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Separation anxiety and vaccination outcomes are shaped by caregiver education, health literacy, transportation, clinic hours, insurance status, trust in institutions, and culturally responsive communication. Historical structural racism and language barriers reduce uptake and increase missed well-child visits. Community-based outreach, flexible scheduling, and family-centered care models mitigate these determinants and, in the spirit of the artwork’s shared space, reframe the clinic as a supportive social environment.</p>
