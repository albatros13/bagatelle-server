        <p><em>Bartholomew Hirst (9)</em></p>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>
        The work is by Damien Hirst, a leading figure associated with the Young British Artists. Hirst’s practice repeatedly engages medicine, mortality, and the display logics of the laboratory and museum. Here, the artist revisits the Christian icon of Saint Bartholomew—the apostle traditionally shown flayed—intertwining devotional imagery with the visual language of surgical demonstration and anatomical teaching models.
        </p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>
        Produced in the early twenty-first century, the sculpture belongs to a period when contemporary art absorbed the aesthetics of biotech and clinical instrumentation. It converses with earlier anatomical revolutions from the sixteenth century onward—particularly Vesalian ecorché displays—while addressing present-day concerns about medical spectacle, the commodification of the body, and the ethics of seeing inside living systems.
        </p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
        <p>
        Saint Bartholomew is classically identified by the attribute of his own flayed skin. In this rendition, the peeled integument hangs like a mantle while the figure brandishes a scalpel, merging martyr’s knife and surgical tool. The stripped musculature evokes the memento mori tradition, reminding viewers of impermanence. The saint’s skin doubles as a relic and a didactic diagram, equating sanctity, suffering, and scientific revelation. The gesture recalls Renaissance prints in which ecorché figures theatrically present their bodies to the viewer as open books.
        </p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>
        The figure’s contrapposto stance quotes classical statuary, yet its metallic, reflective surface imposes a clinical chill that distances flesh into object. Rhythm is established by striated muscle bundles running along limbs and torso, while the drooping skin creates a counter-rhythm of organic folds. The work balances idealized proportion with hyper-detailed anatomy, uniting classical harmony and empirical observation. The pedestal and tool amplify a studio-laboratory hybridity, staging the sculpture as both altar and operating table.
        </p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>
        Historically, access to cadavers for dissection was entangled with power: the bodies of criminals, the poor, and colonized subjects disproportionately supplied anatomical theaters and medical schools. The iconography of a holy man flayed can obscure, yet also point to, those unequal histories of bodily exposure. In contemporary contexts, occupational injuries that literally “deglove” skin occur more often among low-wage and migrant workers, highlighting how economic precarity continues to determine whose bodies bear medical risk and which forms of suffering are aestheticized or rendered invisible.
        </p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>
        The biomedical analogue evoked here is a traumatic degloving injury—an avulsion in which the skin and subcutaneous tissue are torn off from underlying fascia and muscle, disrupting perforating vessels. Etiologies include high-energy road traffic accidents, conveyor belt and roller machinery incidents, agricultural equipment, and crush-shear forces. Although not a “disease” in the infectious sense, degloving constitutes a severe soft-tissue pathology with systemic implications (hypovolemia, contamination, and risk of infection).
        </p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>
        Clinically, degloved tissue ranges from pallid, insensate flaps with absent capillary refill to frankly necrotic skin. Ecchymosis, edema, and shearing blisters may border zones of nonviable tissue; sensory and motor deficits signal deeper injury. The artwork’s exposed musculature and draped integument allegorize these features: the separation plane corresponds to the relatively avascular areolar layer, while visible muscle striations underscore how vascular integrity determines tissue survival. Psychological trauma and disfigurement—less visible signs—are also implicated, echoing themes of pain and endurance in martyr iconography.
        </p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>
        Management follows trauma protocols: hemostasis, irrigation, tetanus prophylaxis, and broad-spectrum antibiotics when contamination is likely. Viable avulsed skin can be defatted and used as a full- or split-thickness graft; otherwise, staged debridement with negative-pressure wound therapy optimizes granulation. Complex cases require microvascular free flaps, dermal substitutes, and delayed grafting. Early physiotherapy, scar modulation, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation address function and appearance, while psychological care targets post-traumatic stress and body-image disturbance. Time-to-revascularization and access to specialist centers critically shape outcomes.
        </p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>
        Injury risk and recovery mirror social gradients: workplace safety standards, training, and enforcement; access to protective equipment; health insurance; transportation to trauma-capable hospitals; and job protections during recovery. Migrant and informal-sector workers face barriers to reporting injuries and obtaining compensation, increasing the likelihood of delayed care, infection, and disability. Community reintegration—prosthetics, occupational retraining, and stigma reduction—depends on social policy as much as surgical expertise.
