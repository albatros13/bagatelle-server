        <p><em>Caption: An ecorché figure life size lying prone on a table (Wellcome L0020561)</em></p>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This drawing belongs to the European academic tradition of écorché studies—life drawings of flayed bodies or models used to teach artists and physicians the structure of skeletal muscles. While the specific draughtsman of this sheet is uncertain in public records, the work reflects the pedagogy shared between art academies and medical schools from the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries, when students copied cadavers or plaster écorché casts to master proportions, surface form, and fiber direction.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The écorché genre matured after the publication of Vesalius’s Fabrica (1543) and expanded dramatically in the Enlightenment and early industrial centuries. New legal access to cadavers, museum collections, and printed anatomical atlases shaped a culture that prized empirical observation. In Britain, reforms culminating in the Anatomy Act of 1832 regularized dissection; in France and Italy, academies maintained robust anatomical theaters. This sheet’s materials—red and white chalk on toned paper—place it squarely in that academic milieu, probably late eighteenth to nineteenth century, when artists sought accuracy while maintaining classical ideals of the body.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The prone body on a slab evokes the dissecting table and the controlled violence of medical inquiry. Skinlessness becomes a symbol of knowledge made visible: the concealment of flesh is removed to reveal the machinery of motion. The exaggerated clarity of fiber striations reads as iconography of truth-telling—muscle as text. The quiet, averted head suppresses individuality, turning the figure into a universal body devoted to instruction rather than portraiture.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Chalks on buff paper create a tri-tone system: black for contour and shadow, red for muscle mass, and white for highlights. Directional hatching follows the pull of fascicles in the deltoid, latissimus dorsi, triceps, and paraspinal groups, so that mark-making mirrors anatomy. A strong diagonal from shoulder to forearm imparts dynamism; cropping tight to the torso underscores the pedagogic focus. The surface is both descriptive and tactile, using value contrast and edge sharpness to distinguish superficial from deep layers.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The écorché tradition is inseparable from inequities surrounding body procurement. Throughout Europe, the poor, incarcerated, and unclaimed dead disproportionately supplied cadavers, often without consent. Colonial networks also moved bodies and knowledge asymmetrically. While the drawing served education and ultimately improved surgical outcomes, it also reflects histories of exclusion—who could study, whose bodies were studied, and who benefited from the resulting expertise.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The sheet primarily represents normative myology, not a specific disease. Nevertheless, its emphasis on the shoulder girdle invites discussion of conditions classically illuminated by écorché pedagogy. Overuse and age-related degeneration produce rotator cuff tendinopathy and tears (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, teres minor). Traumatic lacerations of the triceps or latissimus may follow falls or industrial accidents common in the period. Infectious myonecrosis (e.g., Clostridium perfringens) historically complicated compound fractures and battlefield wounds, while inflammatory myopathies arise from autoimmune etiologies. These pathologies exploit the very architectures so legibly drawn here.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinical signs pertinent to the regions depicted include: superior-lateral shoulder pain and painful arc (rotator cuff disease), weakness in abduction/external rotation, atrophy in the supraspinous fossa, and scapular winging indicating long thoracic or spinal accessory nerve injury. Muscle tears present with ecchymosis, palpable defects, and loss of function along fiber lines. Infections manifest with rapidly progressive pain, crepitus, systemic toxicity, and require emergent care. None of these are asserted as present in the artwork; rather, the anatomy visualized provides the map for recognizing them.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Evidence-based care varies by diagnosis. For rotator cuff tendinopathy: activity modification; structured physiotherapy emphasizing scapular stabilization and eccentric loading; short courses of NSAIDs; judicious subacromial corticosteroid injections for refractory pain; and arthroscopic repair for full-thickness tears with functional impairment. For traumatic muscle injuries: the PEACE & LOVE protocol (protection, elevation, avoid anti-inflammatories early if heavy bleeding risk, compression, education; then load, optimism, vascularization, exercise). Infectious myonecrosis demands broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, urgent surgical debridement, and supportive critical care. Rehabilitation should restore range, proprioception, and strength following anatomical lines made explicit in the drawing.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Occupational strain, limited access to preventive care and physiotherapy, and insurance or geographic barriers shape musculoskeletal outcomes. Historically, the same socioeconomic groups whose bodies entered dissecting rooms also bore higher injury rates from manual labor and military service. Contemporary disparities continue across income, race, and migration status, influencing time to diagnosis, surgical referral, and postoperative recovery environments.</p>
