        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</strong><br>
        The panel depicts Saint Bartholomew, long recognizable in Christian art by the emblem of his flayed skin. While attribution varies in different catalogues and inventories, the work sits securely within the Italian Renaissance devotional tradition often associated with workshops active under masters named Giovanni. The maker’s priority is not portraiture but the didactic power of a saint’s body as sign. The artist renders Bartholomew’s musculature in a striking monochrome red, emphasizing both spiritual endurance and the descriptive potential of anatomy at a time when painters and viewers were increasingly attentive to the body’s structure.</p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</strong><br>
        The image belongs to a late medieval–early Renaissance context (circa fifteenth century), when small and medium-sized panels of single saints were commissioned for altarpieces, chapels, and confraternal spaces. In Italy, renewed urban prosperity, lay piety, and the growth of hospitals and charitable confraternities fostered a devotional culture centered on intercession and the exemplary lives of martyrs. The cult of the saints intersected with health: relics, pilgrimages, and images were mobilized in prayer against plague, skin diseases, and surgical perils. The austere black ground and gold frame link the work to a liturgical and processional environment, where clarity of figure and attribute aided recognition across diverse congregations.</p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</strong><br>
        Bartholomew’s halo affirms sanctity; the vivid red figure represents a body divested of skin, a concise iconographic statement of his martyrdom by flaying. The pale drapery evokes the saint’s removed integument, treated here as a sanctified veil. The absence of narrative setting intensifies the symbolic reading: the saint’s body becomes both reliquary and text. In Christian exegesis, skin signifies human vulnerability and the limits of flesh; the saint who bears its loss without spiritual collapse is a model of steadfast faith. The image’s chromatic polarity—red flesh against a void-like black—frames martyrdom as passage from carnal suffering to transcendent witness.</p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</strong><br>
        The composition is frontal and hieratic, with emphatic contour lines and controlled chiaroscuro that define major muscle groups. The figure stands in a softened contrapposto, enlivening an otherwise iconic pose. Color is architectural: saturated red organizes the field; the white “skin” drapery articulates rhythmic folds, and the dark ground suspends the saint outside time. The gold edge functions as spatial and devotional threshold. Such stylization negotiates between Gothic linearity and Renaissance corporeality, aligning the painter with contemporaneous interest in anatomical description while maintaining the legibility required for worship.</p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</strong><br>
        Martyr imagery records histories of imperial violence and minority vulnerability. Bartholomew’s flaying dramatizes how authority inscribes power on bodies. In late medieval cities, access to healers, hospitals, and protective patronage was stratified by class and gender; confraternities mediated aid but often prioritized insiders. Images like this both comforted the afflicted and reinforced hierarchies, privileging donors and institutional settings where such panels were displayed. The saint’s exposed body can thus be read as both universalizing suffering and reflecting a social order in which some bodies were more protected than others.</p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</strong><br>
        Medically, the condition depicted corresponds to catastrophic full-thickness skin loss—an extensive degloving/flaying injury. Etiology here is deliberate trauma rather than disease, but its physiology parallels large-area burns: destruction of the epidermis and dermis abolishes barrier function, precipitating massive fluid loss, hypothermia, and high risk of infection. Exposed musculature is vulnerable to desiccation and necrosis. Pain is extreme due to exposed nerve endings. Without rapid hemostasis and resuscitation, mortality arises from hemorrhagic and distributive shock, followed by sepsis in survivors.</p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</strong><br>
        The artist’s uniform crimson tonality signals denuded vascular muscle beds; lack of epidermal texture emphasizes total integumentary loss. The gaunt face suggests catabolic stress. Clinically, such an injury would present with tachycardia, hypotension, cool extremities from hypovolemia, and later signs of systemic inflammatory response—fever or hypothermia, altered mentation, and coagulopathy. Infections from skin flora and environmental pathogens would progress rapidly without antimicrobial coverage and wound control.</p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment</strong><br>
        Historical care would have included cleansing with wine or vinegar, herbal unguents, honey-based dressings, and prayerful intercession; premodern surgery could ligate vessels but lacked asepsis and antibiotics, making survival unlikely. Contemporary management treats comparable skin-loss injuries with airway and hemodynamic stabilization, aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, temperature control, analgesia, and staged debridement. Negative-pressure wound therapy can optimize granulation, followed by split-thickness skin grafts or flap coverage, with rehabilitation for function and scar modulation.</p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</strong><br>
        The saint’s fate reflects structural forces—political repression, judicial torture, and religious persecution. More broadly, outcomes after severe trauma correlate with determinants such as access to emergency transport, surgical theaters, blood products, and postoperative care; poverty and conflict zones magnify mortality. In premodern Europe, hospitals run by religious orders provided charity but were unevenly distributed; today, disparities in insurance coverage, antimicrobial availability, and reconstructive services perpetuate differential survival for those suffering major skin-loss injuries.</p>
