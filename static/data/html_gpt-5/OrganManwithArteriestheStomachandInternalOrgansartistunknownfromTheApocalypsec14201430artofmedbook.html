        <h1>Organ Man with Arteries, the Stomach and Internal Organs (c.1420–1430)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            The work is attributed to an anonymous European scribe-illustrator working within a medical or monastic workshop. Such images often emerged from scriptoria where physicians, barber-surgeons, and clerics collaborated to copy Latin translations of Greco-Arabic authorities. The figure belongs to the family of didactic diagrams known as “organ man” or “anatomical man,” closely related to “vein man,” “wound man,” and “zodiac man,” which functioned as mnemonic tools for practitioners and students.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            Produced around 1420–1430, the sheet reflects the late medieval medical culture of Western Europe after the great translation movements from Arabic into Latin (12th–13th centuries) and in the shadow of recurrent plague. Universities at Paris, Bologna, Padua, and Montpellier standardized curricula rooted in Galen, Avicenna, and Hippocratic texts. Anatomical dissection was sporadically practiced in university towns, but most clinical reasoning relied on textual commentary, astrology, and bedside arts such as pulse-taking and uroscopy.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
            The standing nude is diagrammatic rather than naturalistic. Colored channels indicate networks of vessels and perhaps nerves; the belly houses simplified renditions of stomach, liver, and intestines. Adjacent marginal diagrams include circles, flasks, and labeled schemata that likely encode humoral states and astrological correspondences. The circular forms echo cosmological models suggesting the microcosm–macrocosm analogy in which the human body mirrors the ordered heavens. The urine flasks symbolize diagnostic authority, while rubricated letters guide the reader through therapeutic choices such as phlebotomy points and timing.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            Linearity dominates: crisp contours and thin washes establish legibility over illusionism. The limited palette—black, red, blue, green—serves a code-like function: red for rubric and vital heat, blue for vessels, green for humoral putrefaction or bile. Spatial depth is suppressed; the figure floats on the parchment with a slight ground line, emphasizing the page as an instructional surface. The layout integrates image and gloss, balancing blocks of script with didactic diagrams to choreograph the reader’s eye through sequential learning.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            Literacy in Latin and access to manuscripts confined this knowledge to clerical and elite medical circles, excluding most women and lay healers. Hospitals were charitable but stratified, with the urban poor and migrants disproportionately exposed to contagion and malnutrition. Period prohibitions on dissection were unevenly enforced, yet religious and civic controls shaped who could study bodies. Local midwives, empirics, and Jewish or Muslim practitioners often faced regulation or marginalization despite their practical expertise.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            The image encodes a humoral etiology: health arises from balanced blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile, each linked to seasons, planets, and temperaments. Disease stems from imbalance triggered by diet, environment, emotional states, celestial influences, or miasma. Modern biomedicine rejects astrological causation but recognizes kernels of environmental insight: air quality, water, seasonality, and nutrition substantially influence infection and chronic disease risk. The schematic mapping of vessels reflects attempts to rationalize circulation centuries before Harvey, conflating veins, arteries, and nerves into a functional road map for interventions.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Marginal uroscopy charts signal diagnostic reliance on color, sediment, and odor of urine to infer fever types, obstruction, or putrefaction. Notations around the torso may correspond to pain sites, organ dominances, or phlebotomy stations. From a modern perspective, urine inspection can indeed reveal glycosuria, hematuria, or infection, though medieval schemes overgeneralized systemic states. The emphasis on complexion, pulse, and excreta reveals an embodied semiotics—reading the body as text—central to clinical practice before laboratory medicine.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Therapy aimed to restore equilibrium through regimen (diet, sleep, exercise), evacuations (bloodletting, emetics, purgatives), and compound drugs derived from simples cataloged by Galen and Avicenna. Bloodletting points mapped to specific veins are implicitly indicated by the vessel network, timed by planetary hours for optimal effect. While venesection can relieve iron overload or polycythemia in modern contexts, routine bleeding likely worsened anemia and infection outcomes. Nevertheless, attention to dietetics and sanitation anticipates preventive medicine, and the page’s algorithmic layout mirrors modern clinical decision aids.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Epidemic vulnerability in the fifteenth century was intensified by urban crowding, trade routes, climatic volatility during the Little Ice Age, and warfare disrupting grain supplies. Occupational exposures—tanners’ chemicals, miners’ dust, and household smoke—shaped morbidity. Gendered labor and legal status affected nutrition and care access. The manuscript, a costly object, embodies information inequality: therapeutic knowledge circulated among guilds and universities, not among peasants who bore the highest disease burden.
