        <h1>An Extract of Plant and Animal Materia Medica (artist unknown)</h1>
        <p>18th‑century Tibetan medical manuscript leaf depicting ingredients for pharmacology.</p>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The work is by an anonymous Tibetan medical illustrator and scribe working within the Sowa Rigpa tradition. Such folios were typically produced collaboratively in monastic medical colleges, where physician-scholars (amchi) supervised draftsmen trained to render plants, minerals, and animals with diagnostic clarity. Rather than a single authorial “artist,” the page embodies a workshop practice tied to lineages associated with the Four Tantras (rGyud bzhi) and its illustrated commentaries, notably the Blue Beryl (Vaiḍūrya sngon po) tradition. The collective goal was didactic accuracy for medical instruction rather than courtly display.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Dating to the 18th century, the folio belongs to a period when Tibetan medicine was institutionally consolidated after the seventeenth-century codifications patronized by the Fifth Dalai Lama and Desi Sangye Gyatso. Medical colleges in Lhasa, central Tibet, and Amdo standardized curricula that integrated Indian, Himalayan, and Inner Asian materia medica. Long-distance trade networks brought musk, spice roots, and mineral pigments across the Plateau, while local high-altitude ecologies supplied endemic species such as rhodiola and juniper. Illustrated manuals were indispensable teaching tools: portable, durable, and legible to students navigating recipes, substitutions, and seasonal adjustments.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The page is arranged in vertical compartments pairing drawings with Tibetan captions. Each vignette functions as an indexical icon: plant forms with distinctive leaves, inflorescences, and root morphologies; zoomorphic sources such as the yak signaled by horns and shaggy coat; and avian or aquatic sources rendered with emblematic profiles. The grid signals taxonomy and order, echoing the physician’s need to classify potency (nus pa), taste (ro), and post-digestive effects. Repetition of seedlings and mature forms gestures to seasonal stages, crucial for harvesting. While largely naturalistic, the images also operate symbolically: upright stems and radiant flower clusters imply “heating” or “arousing” properties linked to bile disorders, whereas rounded, water-rich leaves suggest “cooling” or phlegm-resolving actions.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The style is planar and diagrammatic: black contour lines enclose flat washes of mineral and botanical pigments, likely including malachite greens and iron-oxide reds. Perspective is minimized to foreground legibility. The horizontal pothi format, with rounded corners and ample margins, reflects manuscript conventions shared with Buddhist scriptures. Design principles favor rhythm and balance: evenly spaced panels, consistent caption placement, and restrained color harmonies yield a calm optical field conducive to memorization. Iconographic economy—only the features needed for identification—serves a proto-scientific visual language. The alternation of flora and fauna enlivens the page while maintaining the mnemonic grid that underpins Tibetan medical pedagogy.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Historically, access to trained amchi and proprietary compound pills varied across regions; monastic centers and urban elites had readier access than remote pastoralists. The materia medica also encodes environmental inequities: rare animal derivatives such as musk commanded high prices and implicated hunting pressures, while women and low-status laborers often gathered alpine herbs under hazardous conditions. In modern contexts, conservation restrictions, global demand, and climate change shift availability and cost, creating new disparities between diaspora clinics, Himalayan communities, and biomedical markets.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Within Sowa Rigpa, illness arises from imbalance of the three nyepa: rLung (wind), mKhris-pa (bile), and Bad-kan (phlegm). Etiologies intertwine diet, behavior, environment, and emotion. Wind disorders stem from depletion, anxiety, or exposure to cold and irregular routines; bile disorders from heat, anger, or pungent foods; phlegm from dampness, sedentary habits, and heavy, sweet diets. The botanical and animal substances pictured are cataloged for their capacities to warm or cool, dry or moisten, purge or tonify—thus modulating humoral disequilibria across digestive, hepatic, cardiovascular, and neuropsychological domains.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Diagnostic signs include pulse qualities and urine analysis alongside symptomatic clusters. Wind patterns present restlessness, insomnia, and migrating pains; bile patterns show bitter taste, fevers, jaundice, and inflammatory skin lesions; phlegm patterns involve heaviness, edema, and sluggish digestion. The page’s emphasis on leaf shape, root texture, and seed heads correlates with expected actions: bitter gentian-like herbs for bile and liver heat; aromatic roots (e.g., spikenard relatives) for wind and mental agitation; astringent fruits (e.g., Terminalia chebula analogs) to normalize digestion and tighten lax tissues.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment combines compound pharmacology (powders, pills, decoctions), dietetics, behavioral regimens, and external therapies such as moxibustion, cupping, and oil massage. Substitution lists allow practitioners to replace scarce animal products with botanicals of similar potency to address ethical and ecological concerns. Modern pharmacological studies corroborate some traditional uses: Terminalia chebula shows antioxidant and gastroprotective effects; Nardostachys jatamansi exhibits neuroprotective and anxiolytic potentials; Cordyceps derivatives demonstrate immunomodulatory actions; Swertia species yield bitter secoiridoids beneficial for hepatobiliary complaints. Evidence remains heterogeneous, and clinical translation requires standardized identification, dosing, and safety evaluation.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Altitude, extreme climate, and seasonal food insecurity shape Tibetan health profiles, predisposing to respiratory disease, nutritional deficits, and stress-related wind disorders. Trade disruptions can limit access to key ingredients, while regulation of wildlife products and land-use changes affect local pharmacopoeias. Education, gendered labor, and migration determine who becomes an amchi or a patient, and who pays for compounded pills. Contemporary collaborations between Sowa Rigpa institutions and public health systems seek to address these determinants through community training, sustainable harvesting, and affordable formularies.</p>
