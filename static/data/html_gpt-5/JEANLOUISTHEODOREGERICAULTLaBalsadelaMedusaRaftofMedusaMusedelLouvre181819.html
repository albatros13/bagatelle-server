        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Théodore Géricault, a leading figure of French Romanticism, produced this monumental canvas early in his career. Trained in the classical tradition yet drawn to contemporary subjects, he fused rigorous anatomical study with the heightened emotion and drama that came to define Romantic art. Géricault collaborated with sailors and survivors for accuracy, consulted physicians, and undertook anatomical studies in hospitals and morgues to capture the corporeal realities of suffering and death.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted in 1818–1819 and shown at the Salon of 1819, the work responds to the 1816 wreck of the French frigate Méduse off the West African coast. The disaster, linked to political patronage under the Bourbon Restoration, exposed official incompetence: too few lifeboats, a poorly led evacuation, and the construction of a makeshift raft that carried 147 people. After nearly two weeks adrift, only a handful survived, recounting dehydration, exposure, violence, and cannibalism. Géricault’s painting aligned with a Romantic-era turn toward the contemporary and the sublime, using the sea disaster as a vehicle for moral critique. Exhibited amid a climate of censorship, it engaged a public eager for modern subjects that questioned state authority and the fragile promises of post-Napoleonic order.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The composition stages two pyramids: at left, a mass of corpses and prostrate bodies symbolizes despair and mortality; at right, a surge of figures culminates in a lookout signaling a distant ship, an emblem of tenuous hope. The raft itself functions as a political allegory of a nation adrift, lashed together by expediency. The tiny vessel on the horizon alludes to the rescue ship and the thin line between salvation and abandonment. Fabric, timber, and storm clouds form a visual rhetoric of contingency, while the bodies become witnesses to nature’s indifference and society’s failures.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Géricault mobilizes Baroque diagonals and Caravaggesque chiaroscuro to orchestrate movement across the canvas. A restricted palette of umbers and greens deepens the sense of decay and brine-soaked wood, while sudden highlights articulate sinew, tendons, and the sheen of saturated skin. The scale—nearly life-size figures on a vast support—enfolds viewers in the event. Contrapuntal rhythms alternate collapse with ascent, using foreshortening and torsion indebted to Michelangelo and Rubens. The careful rendering of texture—coarse sailcloth, water-slick flesh, splintered planks—anchors the sublime storm in palpable materiality.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The catastrophe stemmed from structural inequities: a command gained through influence, not competence; an evacuation privileging rank; and inadequate provisioning for those relegated to the raft. The painting registers these injustices by foregrounding anonymous sufferers rather than celebrated heroes. It also gestures toward maritime labor hierarchies and colonial circuits within which the voyage took place. By elevating those discarded by policy to the center of monumental history painting, Géricault indicts social systems that convert administrative negligence into mass casualty events.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Survivor accounts and the visual evidence align with starvation, dehydration, exposure, septic trauma, and deficiency disease. Lack of potable water leads to hypernatremia, hypovolemia, acute kidney injury, and delirium. Starvation triggers catabolism of glycogen, fat, and then muscle, with proteolysis producing cachexia and weakness. Vitamin C depletion over weeks precipitates scurvy—capillary fragility, bleeding gums, impaired collagen synthesis, and poor wound healing—exacerbating mortality. Immersion and abrasions invite soft-tissue infection and gangrene. Circadian extremes—solar radiation by day and chilling winds at night—produce alternating hyperthermia and hypothermia, further deranging metabolism and mentation.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The emaciated limbs, protruding ribs, and sunken abdomens signify advanced catabolic state. Mottled skin and slack musculature suggest dehydration and exhaustion; pallor and ecchymotic discolorations point to hemorrhagic tendencies consistent with vitamin C deficiency. Lividity and rigor in the dead underscore postmortem change derived from first-hand anatomical study. Bandaged extremities imply improvised attempts to staunch bleeding or stabilize fractures. Glassy stares and disorganized gestures signal delirium from electrolyte imbalance, sepsis, or sleep deprivation. The fetid sail and drenched deck act as vectors of contamination, amplifying the plausibility of wound infection.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Contemporary best practice would prioritize triage, airway-breathing-circulation, and gradual rehydration with balanced solutions to avoid osmotic shifts. Controlled refeeding with carbohydrate and thiamine supplementation mitigates refeeding syndrome. Empiric antibiotics for contaminated wounds, debridement, and—if necessary—amputation address necrosis. Passive rewarming for hypothermia, sun protection, and analgesia restore physiological stability. For scurvy, rapid vitamin C replacement through citrus or ascorbic acid reverses bleeding and malaise within days. Psychological first aid and long-term trauma care address neuropsychiatric sequelae.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Maritime governance, training, and procurement shaped survival odds more than individual will. Lifeboat access, rationing, navigation knowledge, and time to rescue were all socially mediated. The raft’s population suffered from policy failures—privilege in evacuation, inadequate water storage, and poor crisis planning—illustrating how administrative choices create exposure, vulnerability, and unequal mortality. The painting remains resonant in an era of sea migrations and disaster medicine, where transport safety, emergency logistics, and ethical allocation of aid continue to decide life and death.</p>
