        <h1>Gout with Pluto, Jupiter, and Neptune; and Gout Patients with Inscription Deploring their Painful State (1537)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            The woodcut is by an unknown early modern artist working within the Northern European print tradition. Its facture—dense hatchings, emphatic contour, and a didactic split composition—aligns with the vernacular of Germanic or Netherlandish workshop production that flourished in the first half of the sixteenth century. The anonymous authorship is typical of medical-moralizing prints disseminated through chapbooks and physicians’ manuals, where communicative function outweighed individual style.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            Dated to 1537, the image belongs to a Reformation-era culture of polemical printing and growing lay interest in the body. Humanist readers collected emblematic images that condensed medical knowledge, classical mythology, and moral commentary. Gout—long associated with affluence—became a topic for satire and admonition, reflecting anxieties about diet, luxury, and aging among urban elites. The period also straddled Galenic humoralism and emerging empirical observation, producing hybrid imagery that invokes both mythic causation and observable suffering.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
            On the left, the gods Neptune, Jupiter, and Pluto personify elemental domains—water, air/heaven, and the underworld—evoking cosmological explanations of disease. Their presence frames gout as a fate governed by planetary or elemental influences. Banners spiral through the space; one Latin motto—often rendered as “Medicina nescit solvere nodosam” (“medicine does not know how to untie the knotted [disease]”)—alludes to the nodosity of tophaceous deposits. On the right, patients hobble on crutches, elevate swollen feet, and appeal to authorities seated like judges—an iconography of supplication that dramatizes chronic pain and the insufficiency of contemporary cures. The juxtaposition of gods and sufferers underscores the perceived inscrutability of gout while satirizing both divine and human jurisdictions.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            The print relies on strong linearity, rapid cross-hatching, and abrupt contrasts to model drapery and flesh. The diptych-like division sets up a rhetorical antithesis; banners operate as visual vectors, guiding the eye while supplying text. Crowded groupings and compressed architectural space intensify claustrophobia, appropriate to an illness that immobilizes movement. The repeated motif of bent knees and elevated feet forms a rhythmic pattern that visually “pinches” the composition, echoing the pinching pain of podagra.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            Early modern culture often branded gout the “patrician malady,” linked to meat, wine, and sedentary privilege. Yet the right panel includes figures in plain garments, reminding us that exposure to lead-adulterated wine or beer, limited access to fresh foods, and occupational kidney stress also burdened artisans and the poor. The moralizing tenor—casting disease as the wages of excess—obscured structural determinants such as contaminated urban water and the economics of grain versus meat, prefiguring modern inequities in diet, environmental toxins, and healthcare access.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            Gout is an autoinflammatory arthritis caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in joints and soft tissues after prolonged hyperuricemia. Uric acid accumulates when production from purine metabolism exceeds renal excretion. Genetic variants (e.g., in URAT1/SLC22A12 and GLUT9/SLC2A9), high-purine diets, alcohol—especially beer and spirits—and fructose-sweetened beverages elevate serum urate. Chronic kidney disease, diuretics, and lead exposure further impair urate clearance. Historically, “saturnine” gout was associated with lead-contaminated beverages and glazes.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Clinically, gout presents as abrupt, nocturnal attacks of severe pain, swelling, erythema, and warmth, classically at the first metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra). The print’s bandaged, elevated feet and crutches are apt signifiers of acute disability. Over time, tophi—subcutaneous urate deposits—form nodular “knots” at ears, fingers, and elbows, matching the “nodosam” rhetoric on the banner. Untreated disease can lead to erosive arthropathy, nephrolithiasis, and chronic kidney dysfunction.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Early modern remedies—purgatives, bloodletting, poultices, thermal baths, and herbal simples—sought to rebalance humors or “draw out” pain; the image’s supplicants suggest skepticism about their efficacy. Evidence-based modern care separates flare management from urate lowering. Acute attacks are treated with NSAIDs, colchicine (microtubule inhibition dampening NLRP3 inflammasome signaling), or corticosteroids. Long-term control relies on urate-lowering therapy: xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol, febuxostat) or uricosurics (probenecid) with prophylactic low-dose colchicine or NSAID during initiation. Lifestyle measures—weight reduction, moderation of alcohol (especially beer/spirits), limiting high-purine meats and some seafoods, and reducing fructose—support pharmacotherapy. Treating comorbidities and addressing nephrotoxic exposures remain essential.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Diet affordability, marketing of sugar-sweetened beverages, occupational dehydration, and unequal access to primary care influence gout incidence and control. Medications like diuretics are more common where hypertension is undertreated, compounding risk. Cultural stigmas—framing gout as self-inflicted excess—can delay care seeking and adherence. Environmental exposures, including residual lead in housing or plumbing, continue to shape risk distributions across communities.
