        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Théodore Géricault (1791–1824) was a leading figure of French Romanticism whose work fused acute social observation with dramatic pictorial effect. Best known for The Raft of the Medusa, he also produced a small series of portraits of psychiatric patients often called the “Monomaniacs.” These paintings, including the present Portrait of a Child Snatcher, combine the ethos of Romantic individualism with an almost clinical scrutiny of the human face, created in dialogue with contemporary physicians interested in mental illness.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted around 1821–1823, during the Bourbon Restoration, the work emerges from a France unsettled by post-Napoleonic disillusion and rapid urban change. At the same time, the new discipline of “alienism” (early psychiatry) took shape through figures such as Philippe Pinel and Jean-Étienne Esquirol, who advanced the “moral treatment” and new nosologies like monomania. Géricault, acquainted with physicians including Étienne-Jean Georget, accessed asylums where patients were categorized by specific delusional fixations. The portraits participated in a broader, modern project: to visualize and classify mental disturbance as part of empirical science and public reform.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The sparse background and half-length format suppress anecdotal narrative, turning the sitter’s physiognomy into the primary “text.” The intense, sidelong gaze, tightened mouth, and shadowed sockets signal the 19th‑century iconography of derangement, a visual vocabulary also seen in medical atlases. Clothing cues—plain cap and dark coat—locate the patient among the urban poor, suggesting precarious status. The title’s “child snatcher” refers to the period diagnosis of monomania: rapt d’enfants, a pathological fixation rather than a comprehensive madness. Thus the image functions symbolically as an “exhibit” for a type, while simultaneously asserting irreducible individuality.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Géricault’s chiaroscuro isolates the head in a tenebrous field, recalling Caravaggesque drama yet stripped of theatrical ornament. The restricted palette of earthen reds and blacks, the painterly impasto around the brow and cheek, and abrupt tonal transitions build psychological tension. Compositional compression—cropping close around the face—creates claustrophobia, mirroring psychic confinement. Texture and broken brushwork interrupt idealization, aligning the piece with proto-Realist aims: the truth of observed surfaces as a conduit to interior states. Balance is asymmetrical, with light raking across one eye, a device that dramatizes divided consciousness.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The series exposes structural inequalities: the criminalization of mental illness, class-based confinement, and the asymmetry of looking. Patients, often poor and anonymous, became subjects in both medical taxonomy and art, rarely with documented consent. While “moral treatment” sought humane reform, asylum regimes could still be coercive. The label “child snatcher” reflects gendered and moral panic discourses of the era, pathologizing deviance within a matrix of poverty, urban crowding, and public fear. Géricault’s sympathetic rendering complicates this: the painting registers human specificity even as it participates in a classificatory gaze.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Esquirol’s monomania denoted a circumscribed delusion with otherwise intact reason. “Child snatching” described a compulsive or delusional focus on abducting children. Retrospectively, such behavior could map onto several modern categories: delusional disorder (persecutory or erotomanic variants), psychotic-spectrum illness with command hallucinations, impulse-control disorders (analogue to kleptomania), or paraphilic disorders in rare forensic contexts. Etiology is heterogeneous: genetic vulnerability, dysregulation of dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways, perinatal or developmental trauma, neurocognitive impairment, and social stressors. Importantly, retrospective diagnosis from an artwork is speculative; the painting instead reflects historical medical epistemologies.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Visual indicators—vacant yet vigilant eyes, facial tension, asymmetric expression, and unkempt attire—operate as culturally coded signifiers of madness rather than reliable clinical signs. In 19th‑century physiognomic thinking, such features indexed interior pathology. Today, clinicians would regard posture, affect, and gaze as non-specific cues within a comprehensive assessment. The painting is valuable precisely because it documents how alienists and artists read the face as a legible symptom, revealing the period’s faith in surface evidence.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Contemporary to the work, treatment combined seclusion, structured routine, work therapy, and sedatives (e.g., laudanum), alongside somatic measures like cold baths; restraint persisted despite reform rhetoric. Modern management depends on the underlying diagnosis: antipsychotics and cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychotic or delusional disorders; cognitive-behavioral strategies and, in some cases, SSRIs or naltrexone for impulse-control problems; specialized psychotherapy and risk management for paraphilic disorders. Ethical standards today emphasize consent, least-restrictive care, and social support integration.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Poverty, housing instability, occupational precarity, trauma, and weak social networks heighten risk for both onset and adverse outcomes in severe mental illness. In Restoration Paris, overcrowding, food insecurity, and postwar disruption intensified vulnerability and shaped pathways to institutionalization. Stigma and punitive legal frameworks further constrained care. Contemporary public health echoes these concerns, documenting how education, discrimination, and access to services modulate incidence, treatment adherence, and recovery.</p>
