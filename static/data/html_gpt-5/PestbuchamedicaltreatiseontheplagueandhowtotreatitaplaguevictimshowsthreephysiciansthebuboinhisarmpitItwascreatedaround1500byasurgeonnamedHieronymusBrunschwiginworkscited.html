        <h1>Pestbuch (c.1500), patient showing a bubo to three physicians — attributed to Hieronymus Brunschwig</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Hieronymus Brunschwig (ca. 1450–ca. 1512) was a Strasbourg surgeon-apothecary whose printed treatises bridged artisanal medical practice and the burgeoning world of vernacular science. Though trained in surgery, he wrote for lay and professional readers, synthesizing classical authorities with hands-on shop knowledge. The image belongs to his Pestbuch (often titled Liber pestilentialis de venenis et pestilentia), where woodcuts serve as practical didactic devices. The anonymous block-cutter translates Brunschwig’s clinical voice into a pictorial lesson on recognition of bubonic plague.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Produced around 1500 in the Holy Roman Empire, the work emerges amid recurrent post–Black Death outbreaks and the rise of print culture. Strasbourg’s presses and guild structures enabled vernacular medical books that addressed epidemic fear, municipal regulation, and household care. Humanist recovery of ancient texts intersected with craft empiricism; physicians, barber-surgeons, and apothecaries negotiated authority during an era of city councils, quarantine ordinances, and religious reform currents soon to culminate in the Reformation.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The seated invalid exposes an axillary swelling—iconic “bubo”—to three consulting practitioners. Gesturing hands enact clinical demonstration; fur-trimmed robes and caps signal learned status, while shelves with jars and distillation vessels reference pharmacy and domestic therapeutics. The bed canopy and tiled floor frame illness within the household interior, reminding viewers that plague care occurred at home, not hospitals. The triad of physicians implies consensus and learned scrutiny, legitimizing the text’s recommendations.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>A late Gothic woodcut, the image uses strong contour lines, cross-hatching, and patterned textiles to create legibility over naturalism. The shallow stage and frontal presentation emphasize intelligibility: the viewer’s eye is led from the patient’s pallid face to the exposed armpit. Black-letter captions integrate text and image in a single pedagogical unit. Repetition of verticals (bedposts, shelving) stabilizes the scene, while rhythmic folds and diagonals animate attention toward the lesion.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Epidemics magnified disparities. Access to physicians and apothecaries favored guild members and the well-to-do; poorer households relied on folk healers, midwives, and municipal charity. Quarantine rules could criminalize mobility and laboring classes; xenophobic scapegoating—especially of Jewish communities and itinerants—accompanied fear, with violence during earlier waves echoing into the sixteenth century. Gendered caregiving exposed women to higher risk yet left minimal archival voice.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The scene depicts bubonic plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. Transmission typically occurs via bites from infected fleas (notably Xenopsylla cheopis) that have fed on bacteremic rodents (Rattus rattus and others). Human-to-human transmission can occur with pneumonic forms via respiratory droplets. After an incubation of roughly 2–8 days, bacteria seed regional lymph nodes draining the site of inoculation, producing painful, necrotic lymphadenitis—the bubo—most commonly in the groin, axilla, or neck.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The axillary swelling shown aligns with lymphatic drainage from the upper limb. Fever, rigors, headache, myalgias, and profound prostration accompany tender buboes; skin mottling and delirium indicate septicemia. Untreated bubonic plague historically carried 50–60% mortality; septicemic and pneumonic forms were higher. The artist’s pallor, recumbency, and attentive physicians capture both clinical gravity and the social ritual of consultation.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Brunschwig’s text recommends regimen (air, diet, sleep), fumigation, aromatic prophylaxis, purgatives, and surgical opening of mature buboes followed by cautery and poultices; compound theriacs and distilled waters reflect the apothecary’s craft. While humoral logic shaped these measures, some practices (isolation, avoidance of miasma-laden air, wound drainage) had partial pragmatic effects. Modern therapy relies on prompt antibiotics—streptomycin or gentamicin; doxycycline or ciprofloxacin as alternatives—plus supportive care and contact tracing. Mortality with early treatment drops dramatically.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Urban density, grain storage attracting rodents, trade networks, seasonal climate fluctuations of the Late Medieval “Little Ice Age,” malnutrition, and conflict all heightened risk. Literacy and access to printed guidance mediated who could implement preventive regimens. Trust in civic authorities and the capacity to quarantine—often impossible for wage laborers—shaped outcomes. The image, by visualizing diagnosis, tries to democratize recognition yet simultaneously inscribes learned authority over lay caregiving.</p>
