        <h1>Anatomical Male Figure Showing Heart, Lungs, and Main Arteries</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This drawing is attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, the Renaissance artist-engineer whose anatomical investigations fused close observation with experimental reasoning. Working with physicians and dissecting human cadavers, he produced hundreds of sheets that aimed to reform how bodies were pictured and understood. His anatomical folios combine diagram, note, and empirical sketch, treating the page as a laboratory for thinking.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in the early sixteenth century (c. 1508–1513), the work belongs to the High Renaissance, when artisan workshops intersected with emerging natural philosophy. Universities still taught Galenic medicine, yet hospital access to the dead, the spread of paper, and the mobility of drawings allowed new forms of inquiry. Leonardo’s mirror-written annotations and multi-view analyses signal a shift from authority to experience: the studio and morgue became allied spaces of knowledge production.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>Although primarily didactic, the figure’s open, frontal stance evokes the Renaissance ideal of the body as a microcosm. The centrally placed heart, flanked by lungs and traced by major vessels, reads as a cartography of life-force. The image suppresses surface musculature to foreground conduits of breath and blood—an iconography of circulation before circulation was formally theorized. The sparse ground and marginal notes assert that truth emerges from the body’s interior rather than from emblem or allegory.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Leonardo’s line alternates between delicate contour and emphatic, slightly thickened strokes to prioritize structures. Washes tint the organs, establishing visual hierarchy through value contrast. Symmetry and proportion organize the page, while directional lines of arteries and veins guide the eye from thorax to extremities, creating a rhythm that mimics physiological flow. The drawing’s legibility—economical modeling, reserved highlights, and sequential labeling—anticipates modern biomedical illustration’s clarity and didactic intent.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Access to cadavers was uneven and ethically fraught. Bodies commonly came from the poor, the unclaimed, or executed individuals, reflecting power imbalances in who could be studied and who could study. Literacy, workshop networks, and patronage enabled a few to codify knowledge. The circulation of anatomical images thus depended on structures that marginalized many—women, non-elites, and communities whose remains became raw material for science without consent.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The organs emphasized invite discussion of cardiopulmonary disease. Cardiovascular illness often stems from atherosclerosis—lipid-rich plaque formation within arterial walls driven by dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and chronic inflammation. Valvular disease may arise from congenital malformation, rheumatic fever, or degenerative calcification. Pulmonary diseases pertinent to the lungs include tuberculosis (infectious etiology by Mycobacterium tuberculosis), bacterial pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) resulting from long-term inhalational exposures, especially tobacco smoke and biomass fuels. While Renaissance medicine framed these conditions in humoral terms, the drawing’s structural accuracy provides a scaffold for later etiologic insight.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Morphologic correlates map readily onto the depicted anatomy: coronary atherosclerosis narrows lumina of coronary arteries; systemic hypertension thickens arterial media and may produce aneurysmal dilation in the aorta; myocardial infarction yields transmural scarring and ventricular remodeling. In the lungs, infectious consolidation fills alveoli with exudate, whereas emphysema features alveolar wall destruction and hyperinflation. Lymphatic and nodal enlargement along bronchial trees may suggest granulomatous disease such as TB. The schema highlights how disruptions in conduits—arterial blockage, valvular stenosis, or compromised bronchial airflow—translate into system-wide dysfunction.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Premodern therapies included purging and bloodletting, guided by humoral balance rather than pathophysiology. Contemporary evidence-based care targets mechanisms: for atherosclerotic disease, lifestyle modification, statins, antiplatelet agents, antihypertensives, and revascularization (PCI or CABG) reduce events. Heart failure care employs ACE inhibitors/ARNI, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid antagonists, and diuretics; selected patients receive devices. Pneumonia is treated with pathogen-directed antibiotics and supportive care; TB requires multidrug regimens over months. COPD management emphasizes smoking cessation, vaccinations, inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids, pulmonary rehabilitation, and, when indicated, oxygen therapy or surgical interventions. Prevention—tobacco control, air-quality regulation, and equitable access to care—remains foundational.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Cardiopulmonary outcomes are shaped by income, education, housing, occupational exposures, structural racism, food environments, and access to preventive services. Urban air pollution, indoor biomass combustion, and crowded living conditions increase lung disease; food insecurity and stress burden cardiovascular risk. The very history of anatomical science, built on unequal access to bodies and learning, reminds us that knowledge advances can coexist with inequity. Public health strategies must integrate clinical care with policy interventions addressing environment, labor, taxation of tobacco, and universal coverage.</p>
