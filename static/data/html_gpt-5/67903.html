<h1>67903</h1>

<p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
Unknown Chinese artisan-physician. This figure belongs to the long tradition of didactic acupuncture models used by practitioners of classical Chinese medicine. Such objects were often produced collaboratively: carvers shaped the body, calligraphers inscribed point names, and physicians advised on the mapping of channels. The lineage is frequently traced to models associated with Wang Weiyi (active ca. 1020–1030), whose systematization of channels became canonical for later makers.</p>

<p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
Teaching figures emerged in the Northern Song dynasty (11th century) as the state formalized medical examinations. Bronze models with apertures filled with water and wax tested candidates’ accuracy: a correctly placed needle released a drop of water. From Ming through Qing periods the format proliferated in bronze, wood, and plaster for academies and private clinics; related models were transmitted to Korea and Japan. Twentieth-century standardization—culminating in PRC-era curricula and WHO point nomenclature—continued to rely on such visual pedagogy. The present object, with its back view dense with perforations and labels, exemplifies a late, clinic-oriented type emphasizing practical therapeutics.</p>

<p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
The dotted perforations and adjacent characters mark acupuncture loci and channel pathways. On the back, the Governing Vessel (Du mai) runs midline, flanked by paired Urinary Bladder (Taiyang) channels; clusters near the lumbar region include BL23 (Shenshu), BL25 (Dachangshu), and GV4 (Mingmen), nodes central to treating low back and constitutional weakness. The stylized topknot and upright stance connote the idealized, normative body—gender neutral in function—used as a universal template for diagnosis and therapy. Each puncture is simultaneously an icon of intervention and a cosmological coordinate linking surface anatomy with the flow of qi.</p>

<p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
The figure balances naturalism and didactic clarity. Proportions are broadly lifelike, but musculature is simplified to foreground an even, grid-like distribution of points. Repetitive indentations generate a rhythmic pattern, visually echoing the pulse of channels. Incised calligraphy integrates text and image, turning the body into a legible map. The weathered surface—abrasions and pigment losses—indexes touch over time, a patina of clinical use that functions as historical evidence.</p>

<p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
Historically, access to learned medicine in China was mediated by literacy, lineage-based apprenticeship, and urban centers; rural patients and women often relied on household remedies or itinerant healers. Patronage favored scholar-physicians who could purchase such models. In the 19th–20th centuries, colonial encounters and biomedical ascendancy marginalized traditional practice before later rehabilitation and regulation. Today, disparities persist: cost of treatment, geographic maldistribution of trained acupuncturists, and variations in insurance coverage shape who benefits from the therapies these models represent.</p>

<p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
The iconography foregrounds disorders of the back; a representative condition is chronic nonspecific low back pain. In classical theory, etiologies include invasion of cold-damp obstructing the Taiyang channel, qi and blood stagnation from strain, and Kidney deficiency failing to nourish the lumbar spine (hence emphasis on BL23 and GV4). Biomedically, common causes encompass myofascial strain, degenerative disc changes, and facet arthropathy, often exacerbated by sedentary work, repetitive lifting, or age-related degeneration.</p>

<p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
Traditional diagnostics would note aching or cold sensation in the lumbar area, stiffness aggravated by weather, and tenderness at Back-Shu points along the Bladder channel. Tongue may appear pale (cold) or dusky (stasis); pulse may be deep and weak (Kidney deficiency) or wiry (stagnation). Biomedical signs include paraspinal muscle spasm, reduced range of motion, pain on extension, and negative red flags for serious pathology; neurologic testing screens for radiculopathy. The clustering of points on the model’s lumbar spine and posterior legs indexes these symptom pathways.</p>

<p>[h] Treatment<br>
Within traditional practice, combinations such as BL23, BL25, BL40, GV3–GV4, and Ashi points are needled to move qi, warm channels, and tonify Kidney. Techniques may include moxibustion over Mingmen for cold patterns and cupping to relieve myofascial tension. Contemporary protocols integrate acupuncture with exercise therapy and ergonomic counseling. Evidence syntheses suggest acupuncture provides modest but clinically meaningful pain and functional improvements for chronic low back pain compared with usual care or sham, particularly when delivered in multiple sessions and combined with movement-based rehabilitation.</p>

<p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
Risk and recovery are shaped by occupation (manual labor, prolonged sitting), income (ability to access care and time off work), housing and heating (exposure to cold-damp), stress and depression, and cultural beliefs about pain. Inclusive health systems that cover nonpharmacologic care, community education on safe lifting and activity, and workplace ergonomics reduce burden and disparities.</p>
