        <h1>Wound Man, late medieval Europe</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The image belongs to the anonymous tradition of European medical illustrators active in scriptoria and urban workshops from the late fourteenth century onward. Such pictures were often produced collaboratively by scribes, illuminators, and practitioner-consultants—barber-surgeons, university-trained physicians, or apothecaries—rather than by named artists. The figure participates in a broader family of didactic types: the “Wound Man,” cataloguing traumatic injuries; the “Zodiac Man” (homo signorum), linking body parts to astrological signs; and the “Bloodletting Man,” indexing venesection sites. These conventions circulated widely in Latin and vernacular manuscripts connected to practitioners such as Guy de Chauliac and John of Arderne and later migrated into early printed surgical manuals.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        Emerging in the 14th century—a moment shaped by the Black Death, the Hundred Years’ War, and urban growth—the image reflects a culture that relied on classical learning (Galenic–Hippocratic humoralism) refracted through scholastic universities and the craft knowledge of surgeons’ guilds. Astrology functioned as a medical decision-making tool, guiding bloodletting, surgery, and prognosis. Manuscripts like this were portable, copied widely, and used in battlefield, town, and monastic hospital settings, where literacy, illustration, and instrument-based care intersected.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The central nude is a compendium body: a single figure bearing multiple lesions stands for many case histories at once. Radiating medallions with zodiac emblems point to body regions under celestial “dominion,” a guide to auspicious timing that was thought to reduce hemorrhage and complications. Weapon wounds, bites, and burns encode etiological categories (steel, animal, fire), while the red pigment of blood signifies life force escaping the body. The posture—frontal, rigid, and receptive—invites reading, transforming the body into an index. Script bands and labels function like marginalia in a practical handbook, turning the page into a mnemonic map for triage and treatment.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        The composition is diagrammatic rather than naturalistic: crisp contour lines, limited palette, and radial symmetry prioritize clarity over anatomical depth. Circles organize knowledge; lines perform as vectors of causation and instruction. Scale is subordinated to didactic emphasis: some lesions are exaggerated to improve legibility. The sheet balances descriptive detail with legible negative space, reinforcing its function as a quick-reference image for operative decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Access to surgical care varied sharply by class, gender, and geography. Elite patients might secure university physicians and specialist surgeons; laborers and soldiers relied on barber-surgeons and itinerant practitioners. Legal and guild structures restricted training pathways, and religious and civic authorities often limited dissection. Women’s healing work was widespread yet under-documented and frequently marginalized. Minority communities also faced barriers to institutional care. The reliance on astrological timing could entrench gatekeeping, as access to calendars and trained interpreters conferred advantage.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        The sheet inventories traumatic pathology—penetrating and blunt injuries from arrows, knives, clubs, animal teeth, and environmental hazards—alongside conditions medieval medicine framed through humoral imbalance and celestial influence. Etiologies include mechanical force, contamination of wounds leading to putrefaction (sepsis), tetanus from soil-borne spores, and hemorrhagic shock. In the contemporary biomedical frame, these map to vascular injury, soft-tissue disruption, ocular trauma, cranial and thoracoabdominal penetration, and bite-related polymicrobial infection.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Visual cues mark clinical states: gaping lacerations and spurting streams indicate arterial injury; darker pooling suggests venous bleeding; puncture paths imply retained foreign bodies; peri-wound reddening hints at inflammation; burns evoke thermal necrosis. The aggregation of multiple simultaneous insults models the polytrauma common to warfare and accidents. Lines to astrological emblems signal prognostic modifiers—sites judged hazardous during certain lunar or zodiacal phases—reflecting risk stratification within medieval epistemology.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Historically, recommended care included hemostasis by pressure, ligature, or cautery; wound cleansing with wine or vinegar; debridement of devitalized tissue; suturing with linen or gut; application of plasters using honey, resins, and plant astringents; and immobilization. Pain relief employed herbal opiates or soporific sponges; surgeons timed venesection and operations to “safe” astrological windows. Contemporary best practice reframes these aims with sterile technique, evidence-based resuscitation, vascular control, tetanus prophylaxis, broad-spectrum antibiotics for bites and contaminated wounds, staged debridement, and damage-control surgery when indicated.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Violence and warfare, hazardous labor, crowding, malnutrition, and poor sanitation amplified trauma incidence and infection risk. Networks of apprenticeship shaped who received competent care; the cost of manuscripts, instruments, and drugs limited availability. Seasonal campaigning and travel affected exposure patterns. Belief systems—particularly astrology—mediated when and whether procedures occurred, altering outcomes independently of pathology.
