        <h1>Two dissected men with a separate section of viscera</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Jacques-Fabien Gautier d’Agoty (1717–1785) was a French artist-technologist famed for advancing color mezzotint printing and for spectacular anatomical images that bridged art and medical pedagogy. Trained with Jacob Christoph Le Blon, he developed multicolor plates that reproduced flesh and tissues with unprecedented chromatic nuance. D’Agoty collaborated with anatomists such as Joseph-Guichard Duverney and Pierre Tarin and produced monumental suites including Myologie complète and anatomical atlases of viscera and sense organs. Although best known for prints, he also produced large painted écorché figures like the present work, aligning painterly illusionism with scientific display.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in the mid-18th century, the image belongs to the Enlightenment moment when anatomical theaters, academies, and an expanding print market brought bodily knowledge to physicians, surgeons, and an educated public. Following William Harvey’s circulation model and preceding Morgagni’s lesion-based pathology, anatomy shifted from scholastic humoralism to empiricism. Cadavers, often sourced from hospitals and prisons, entered regulated dissection. Paris and other centers institutionalized demonstrative anatomy, while collectors and publishers sought large, striking works that signaled both scientific virtuosity and refined taste.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The flayed standing figure—the écorché—poses with a classical contrapposto, turning the dissected body into a learned, almost heroic form. The cranial and visceral sections below function like a didactic still life: the brain (reason), heart and great vessels (vitality), and layered muscles (strength). The green ground sets off warm reds and ochres of muscle, intensifying the visceral encounter. As memento mori, the image reminds viewers of mortality; as Enlightenment emblem, it celebrates rational dissection as a path to knowledge. The carefully arranged organs suggest a taxonomy of parts, transforming the corpse into an ordered archive.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>D’Agoty applies strong chiaroscuro to model muscle bellies and tendons, using graded reds and yellows to articulate planes. The elongated vertical format stages a full corporeal itinerary—from skull to foot—while the ancillary sections create a secondary narrative space. Edges are precise, almost diagrammatic, yet surfaces retain painterly softness, merging didactic clarity with sensuous description. Color operates analytically: arterial reds, pallid bone, and cartilaginous tans separate systems. The composition balances scientific legibility (label-like separation of parts) with baroque drama (torqued stance, spotlighting), a hybrid language that made his works both collectible and practical.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The era’s anatomical enterprise relied disproportionately on the bodies of the poor, executed criminals, and hospital dead. Consent, as now understood, was rarely sought; social hierarchies mapped directly onto postmortem use. Surgeons and printers profited culturally and economically, while the unclaimed dead supplied material. Moreover, access to anatomical knowledge—costly atlases and private lectures—was restricted to elites, reinforcing professional boundaries. These inequities underpin the visual splendor: the clarity of the image depends on invisible labor (dissectors, preparators) and on historical asymmetries in whose bodies were opened to view.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The work primarily depicts normative anatomy rather than a discrete pathology. Its biomedical content emphasizes structural relations: musculature of the limbs and trunk, thoracic organs with major vessels, and sectional neuroanatomy. In the 1740s–1760s, disease causation was undergoing a conceptual shift toward organ-based lesions, culminating in Giovanni Battista Morgagni’s De Sedibus (1761). D’Agoty’s naturalistic coloration and sectional logic align with this etiological turn—training viewers to correlate symptoms with sites within the body, even if the figure itself is not pathognomonic.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>No specific disease signs are asserted; instead, the image equips observers to recognize deviations. The exposed heart and great vessels orient learners to aneurysmal dilatations or pericardial effusions; the lung fields’ spatial relations recall pleural pathology; layered muscles help identify atrophy patterns and surgical planes. The brain sections, rendered with clear ventricular spaces and cortical ribbons, support localization of lesions—an epistemic move crucial to later clinico-pathological correlation. Chromatic intensification of vessels is didactic rather than diagnostic, but it helped habituate clinicians to visual reading of pathology.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the mid-18th century, therapeutics combined traditional regimens with increasingly precise surgery. Anatomical knowledge underpinned arterial ligature, lithotomy, and obstetric interventions, though outcomes were constrained by the pre-anesthesia (before 1846) and pre-antisepsis (before Lister, 1860s) environment. Hemostasis improved through devices like the screw tourniquet; anatomy-driven approaches to hernias and amputations reduced operative time. Pharmacology still drew on botanical materia medica, while inoculation against smallpox spread unevenly. The image’s clear planes and vascular mapping served surgeons planning incisions and anticipating hemorrhage in a world without reliable pain control or infection prevention.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Urban crowding, occupational exposures, poor nutrition, and limited sanitation shaped 18th-century morbidity—especially tuberculosis and epidemic infections. Access to trained surgeons and apothecaries tracked wealth and proximity to hospitals such as Paris’s Hôtel-Dieu. Literacy and cost restricted who could benefit from printed anatomical knowledge. Even as images like this promised universal reason, structural conditions—poverty, carceral systems, and gendered exclusions from medical education—organized who fell ill, who was treated, and whose bodies became substrates for learning.</p>
