        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571–1610) was the pivotal Italian Baroque painter whose radical naturalism and theatrical illumination transformed European painting. The work commonly titled Sleeping Cupid (Amorino dormiente) belongs to his late career, when he stressed corporeal immediacy over idealization. Caravaggio’s studio practice relied on live models and close observation, rendering flesh, gravity, and light with uncompromising specificity. His painterly language—now termed tenebrism—married devotional intensity to a startling scrutiny of the everyday body, including children and adolescents cast in emblematic roles from classical mythology and Christian typology.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Sleeping Cupid is generally dated to about 1608, during Caravaggio’s itinerant years after his flight from Rome. The Counter‑Reformation shaped expectations for clarity, moral efficacy, and affective engagement in art; patrons sought images that disciplined the senses yet moved the viewer. In Malta and southern Italy, Caravaggio refined nocturnal settings that isolate figures against vast darkness, aligning visual drama with spiritual vigilance. The picture belongs to a broader early‑seventeenth‑century discourse in which classical gods were reinterpreted through Christian moral philosophy, the human body was newly studied in anatomical theaters, and naturalistic depiction became a vehicle for ethical instruction.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The sleeping child is Eros—identified by the bow, arrows, and small wings—rendered not as triumphant desire but as disarmed and vulnerable. Sleep connotes the temporary suspension of impulse, a vanitas motif signaling the fragility and mutability of human passions. The dimly lit feathers and inert weaponry allegorize the quelling of erotic disturbance; Cupid’s torpor functions as a moral emblem of chastity, or the subordination of appetite to reason. The close, earthbound setting and extinguished activity also echo early modern meditations on sleep as a “little death,” a pause that throws mortal contingency and divine providence into relief.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Caravaggio orchestrates a severe chiaroscuro: a single, raking light articulates the torso and abdomen while leaving the background in near-total obscurity. The composition is low and horizontal, with the child’s body forming a diagonal that guides the eye from head to heel, balanced by the counter-diagonal of the bow. Tactile contrasts—soft flesh, brittle feathers, and polished wood—are heightened by a restricted, warm palette. The negative space intensifies presence, turning the figure into a still-life of sleeping flesh. Tenebrism here is not mere effect; it structures attention and temporality, staging perception itself as an ethical act of watchfulness over a defenseless body.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Images like this relied on the availability of child models, often drawn from precarious social strata. Early modern economies of patronage privileged elite moralizing narratives while obscuring the material conditions of the sitter. The Counter‑Reformation’s regulation of sexuality and gendered behavior inflected the iconography of Cupid “put to sleep,” encoding discipline of desire within broader hierarchies of class and clerical authority. Such pictures thus sit at the intersection of aesthetic innovation and social asymmetry—where the bodies of the poor could become vehicles for elite ethical exempla.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While the painting does not diagnose a specific illness, its frank depiction of a young child invites discussion of pediatric health in Caravaggio’s era—especially nutritional rickets, common in early modern Europe. Rickets arises from inadequate vitamin D and/or calcium, impairing mineralization at the growth plate. Vitamin D deficiency lowers intestinal calcium absorption, provoking secondary hyperparathyroidism and mobilization of bone minerals, leading to skeletal deformity and delayed growth. Contributing factors historically included poverty, limited sun exposure (due to swaddling, indoor labor, or cultural dress), darker skin at higher latitudes, malabsorption, and diets lacking fish liver oils or fortified foods. The work provides a historically apt lens for considering the disease rather than evidence of it.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinical features of nutritional rickets include bowing of the long bones, widening of wrists and ankles, a “rachitic rosary” at the costochondral junctions, delayed closure of fontanelles, hypotonia, and a protuberant abdomen due to muscle weakness and lumbar lordosis. In this image, a softly distended toddler abdomen and relaxed limbs are visible, but there is no unequivocal depiction of wrist widening or leg bowing; such traits may simply reflect normal infant proportions and Caravaggio’s fidelity to gravity and flesh. Any medical inference from the painting should therefore remain cautious and non-diagnostic.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Historically, sun‑bathing and cod‑liver oil were the first effective therapies. Contemporary management centers on vitamin D3 supplementation and adequate dietary calcium, with dosing tailored to severity and age per clinical guidelines; underlying causes (malabsorption, renal or hepatic disease) must be addressed when present. Public health measures—food fortification, maternal supplementation in pregnancy, and safe sunlight practices—have proven effective in preventing recurrence at the population level.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Rickets historically mapped onto poverty, housing density, and labor conditions that limited outdoor light exposure. Cultural norms around swaddling and modest dress, latitude and seasonality, skin pigmentation, and maternal nutrition shaped risk. Access to fortified foods and primary care, as well as education about infant feeding, remain decisive determinants today. Read through this painting’s quiet body, such factors remind us that health is co-produced by biology, environment, and social policy.</p>
