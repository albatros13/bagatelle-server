        <h1>Lam Qua — A Seated Chinese Man Po Ashing from Guangzhou with a Very Large Tumor on his Left Arm (1836)</h1>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Lam Qua (Guan Qiaochang, ca. 1801–1860) was a Cantonese painter associated with the export painting tradition centered near the Thirteen Factories district of Guangzhou. Trained in Western-style portraiture, he produced a remarkable series of medical portraits for the American missionary-surgeon Peter Parker at the Canton Hospital. These images merge commercial studio practice with clinical documentation, creating one of the earliest sustained collaborations between art and Western surgery in China.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>The work dates to the mid-1830s, just before the Opium War and during the constrained “Canton System,” when foreign trade was restricted to Guangzhou. Missionary medicine entered this milieu as both humanitarian endeavor and instrument of cultural encounter. Parker’s ophthalmic hospital (founded 1835) treated ophthalmic disease as well as tumors and other surgical cases; the portraits functioned as teaching, record-keeping, and fundraising tools circulated among Euro-American audiences eager for visual testimony of surgical “miracles” in China.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
        <p>The sitter appears on a simple bench against a blank backdrop, a clinical stage that strips away social attributes to focus on pathology. The white cloth at the waist and the folded paper in the right hand read as cues of cleanliness and administrative order—tokens of the hospital encounter. The massive, pendulous swelling commands the composition, a literal and metaphorical weight. Viewers of the time read such bodies as evidence of suffering relieved by Western surgery; today, the image also indexes the patient’s endurance in a system that made his disease a spectacle.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>Lam Qua’s handling combines export portrait conventions—frontality, smooth surfaces, precise contour—with Western chiaroscuro to model flesh. The restrained palette isolates warm skin tones against a cool void, heightening contrast and directing the eye to the lesion’s volume. Proportion is deliberately skewed: the arm’s hypertrophy dominates negative space, a compositional emphasis that anticipates modern clinical photography. The brushwork’s evenness and the absence of cast shadow around the tumor enhance legibility, prioritizing description over painterly flourish.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The image embodies asymmetries of power: a foreign-run hospital, a patient likely of modest means, and a portrait meant primarily for distant patrons. Naming conventions often reduce the sitter to a case, reflecting 19th-century medical objectification. Access to care was shaped by poverty, occupation, and travel constraints; disfigurement carried social stigma that could limit labor and marriage prospects. The portrait thus records both illness and the structural conditions that made timely intervention difficult.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The lesion appears as a very large, lobulated, soft-tissue mass of the proximal left arm with stretched, thinned skin and superficial venous markings. Differential diagnoses include: (1) plexiform neurofibroma associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a tumor of peripheral nerve sheath origin driven by biallelic loss of NF1 leading to RAS/MAPK pathway activation; (2) giant lipoma or atypical lipomatous tumor (well-differentiated liposarcoma), arising from adipocytes with MDM2/CDK4 amplification; (3) vascular or lymphatic malformation; and less likely (4) elephantiasis due to chronic lymphatic filariasis, which typically produces diffuse edema rather than a discrete mass. Without histology or imaging, definitive diagnosis is impossible, but the discrete, pendulous contour favors a neurogenic or adipocytic neoplasm.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Visual signs include massive asymmetric enlargement, gravity-dependent sagging, skin striae, and surface telangiectasia or veins. The shoulder girdle is otherwise preserved, suggesting a tumor arising distal to the deltoid insertion. The sitter’s guarded posture of the left hand hints at weakness or neuropathic discomfort. Lack of ulceration or infection suggests slow growth and viable overlying skin, characteristic of benign but deforming lesions like plexiform neurofibroma or lipoma.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>In the 1830s, surgery at the Canton Hospital preceded ether anesthesia (1846) and antisepsis (1860s). Procedures relied on speed, alcohol/opium analgesia, and meticulous hemostasis; mortality from sepsis and hemorrhage was substantial. Parker nonetheless performed numerous tumor excisions, and some documented sitters underwent successful removal. Contemporary management would include MRI to define extent, core-needle biopsy for histologic subtype, and multidisciplinary planning. Plexiform neurofibromas may be observed, debulked surgically for pain or functional compromise, or treated with MEK inhibitors such as selumetinib in pediatric or selected adult NF1 cases. Lipomatous tumors are treated with marginal to wide local excision; sarcomas require oncologic resection with or without radiotherapy, and targeted or cytotoxic agents when high grade or metastatic. Lymphatic malformations and lymphedema are approached with compression, physiotherapy, sclerotherapy, or debulking surgery.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Delayed presentation likely reflects economic precarity, limited rural–urban mobility, and skepticism toward invasive procedures. Occupational demands could exacerbate growth-related impairment. Cultural stigma around conspicuous disfigurement may have motivated help-seeking while simultaneously restricting participation in public life. The portrait also attests to how charity care, missionary networks, and transnational philanthropy mediated who received treatment and how their bodies were represented.</p>
