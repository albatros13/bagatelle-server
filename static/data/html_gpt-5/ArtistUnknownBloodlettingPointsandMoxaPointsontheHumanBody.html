<h1>Bloodletting Points and Moxa Points on the Human Body</h1>

<h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
<p>
Artist unknown. The painting belongs to the Tibetan Sowa Rigpa medical tradition, a scholastic and artisanal milieu that flourished in monastic colleges and medical houses across Tibet and the Himalayas. Such charts descend from the illustrated Blue Beryl (Vaiḍūrya sngon po) project patronized by Desi Sangye Gyatso in the late 17th century, where teams of painters standardized medical imagery for pedagogy. The work likely reflects the collaborative practices of medical thangka workshops, in which physicians, scribes, and painters coordinated text, calligraphy, and visual conventions to codify treatment loci for bloodletting and moxibustion.
</p>

<h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
<p>
The imagery corresponds to curricula in Tibetan medical colleges from the 17th to the 19th centuries, when the Four Tantras (rGyud bzhi) served as the doctrinal backbone of diagnosis and therapy. Within a Buddhist polity, medicine was framed as compassionate service, and visual teaching aids allowed memorization by apprentices who learned pulse, urine diagnosis, and therapeutic sequences. This period saw systematization of procedures—venesection, cautery, moxibustion—adapted to high-altitude lifeways. The painting’s didactic frontality and dense inscriptions index its use in classroom recitation and in itinerant practice, where portable, durable thangkas could be unrolled for quick reference.
</p>

<h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
<p>
The front-facing male body is marked by colored dots and captions in Tibetan script, denoting recommended points for bloodletting and for moxa. The chromatic coding distinguishes categories (for example, cautery versus venesection) and relative indications. Internal schemata in the torso allude to channels (rtsa) and organ regions rather than anatomical realism, expressing a functional cartography of winds (rlung), bile (mkhris pa), phlegm (bad kan), and blood. The pose with raised arms clarifies access to axillary and upper-limb points, while symmetry communicates balance—an ethical and physiological ideal of Sowa Rigpa.
</p>

<h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
<p>
Opaque mineral pigments and firm contour lines produce flat, legible color fields, prioritizing information over illusionism. The composition is axial and bilaterally symmetrical; repetition of circular markers guides the eye in didactic rhythms. Calligraphic notations integrate image and text, functioning as labels and mnemonic prompts. The restrained palette—earth reds, yellows, blue accents—links the body to a stable, green ground, isolating medical content from narrative setting and maintaining clarity for instructional use.
</p>

<h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
<p>
Tibetan medical care historically stratified along geography, class, and gender. Remote pastoral communities faced seasonal barriers to clinics; monastic institutions concentrated expertise in urban centers like Lhasa. Literacy in Tibetan scripts shaped who could train and who could benefit from visual manuals. Gendered norms around bodily exposure may have influenced diagnostic access for women, despite parallel traditions of female healers in some regions. Such inequities persist today in Himalayan areas with uneven integration of biomedicine and Sowa Rigpa services.
</p>

<h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
<p>
Within Sowa Rigpa, disease arises from imbalance of the three nyes pa—wind (rlung), bile (mkhris pa), and phlegm (bad kan)—modulated by diet, habits, climate, age, and emotion. Blood is both a constituent and a pathogenic agent when stagnant or excessive heat accumulates. External factors (seasonal wind, pathogens) and internal factors (dietary heaviness, anger, anxiety) disturb channels and winds, generating pain, swelling, erythema, or cold-numb patterns. The therapeutic logic of the chart maps where venting blood or applying heat restores flow, disperses stasis, and rebalances humors.
</p>

<h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
<p>
Points cluster at joints, scalp, and along channel tracts corresponding to common complaints: cephalgia, arthralgia, dermatologic eruptions, hemorrhoids, and ocular or auricular inflammations. Visual emphasis on knees, ankles, and hands mirrors everyday overuse injuries in agrarian and pastoral labor. In clinical context, point selection follows pattern differentiation by pulse qualities, urine chromatics, lesion color/temperature, and the temporal rhythm of symptoms, aligning specific loci to hot or cold, excess or deficiency states.
</p>

<h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
<p>
Moxibustion (me btsa) applies burning Artemisia cones or sticks to selected points to warm channels, especially for cold-phlegm disorders, chronic pain, or digestive weakness. Bloodletting uses lancets or horn cups to release a measured quantity of blood for heat-toxin, rashes, or congestive headaches. Protocols specify seasons, contraindications, and aftercare. Contemporary evidence for moxa is mixed but suggests benefit for some pain conditions and for turning breech fetuses; therapeutic phlebotomy remains biomedical standard for hemochromatosis and polycythemia, though indiscriminate bleeding is contraindicated. Sterility and dosage are critical in any setting.
</p>

<h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
<p>
High altitude, cold climate, and a diet rich in meat and butter predispose to cold-damp patterns and vascular strain. Nomadic mobility, limited sanitation, and arduous labor contribute to trauma and infection risks. Trade disruptions and political marginalization have historically constrained access to trained physicians and materia medica. Ritual obligations and local cosmologies also shape health-seeking behavior, from monastery clinics to household remedies, influencing timeliness of treatment and outcomes.
