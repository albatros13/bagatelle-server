        <h1>Theodore Géricault, Portrait of a Woman Suffering from Obsessive Envy (The Hyena), 1822</h1>

        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
        Théodore Géricault (1791–1824) was a pivotal French Romantic painter whose fascination with the extremes of human emotion and the body’s material reality linked studio practice with emerging medical discourses. Trained under Carle Vernet and Pierre-Narcisse Guérin, he combined rigorous anatomical study with a journalistic eye for contemporary life. Late in his brief career, Géricault collaborated with psychiatrist Étienne-Jean Georget to produce a group of clinical-psychological portraits—often called the “Monomania” series—of which this painting of obsessive envy is a key work.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)<br>
        Painted around 1822 during the Bourbon Restoration, the portrait belongs to a moment when French psychiatry was consolidating as a medical specialty after the reforms associated with Philippe Pinel and his student Jean-Étienne Esquirol. Asylums such as the Salpêtrière became laboratories of observation, classification, and “moral treatment.” The Romantic generation was simultaneously interrogating reason’s limits after the Napoleonic upheavals. Géricault’s project intersects these currents: the canvas records an individual pathology while critiquing social marginalization and the spectacle of madness in post-revolutionary Paris.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography<br>
        The white coif, layered shawls, and muted garments signal working-class status and institutional life, while the red scarf punctuates the otherwise earthen palette, suggesting inner agitation. The epithet “The Hyena”—likely a period nickname—reflects 19th-century habit of animalizing the insane, a symbolic violence the painting itself quietly resists by maintaining humane, individualized attention. The dark, undefined background isolates the sitter, turning expression, wrinkle, and gaze into iconographic indices of an inner condition rather than narrative props or allegory.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
        Géricault’s close-cropped half-length format, pronounced chiaroscuro, and restrained color heighten psychological presence. Loose, economical brushwork models the face with palpable tactility, while the garment’s broad planes create rhythm and weight. Compositional emphasis falls on the head and hands through directional light and value contrast. The dark ground dissolves spatial context, intensifying figure–ground relationships and producing a compassionate realism distinct from caricature. The result is a Romantic naturalism: specific, affective, and ethically charged, anticipating later realist portraiture of social types.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
        The painting illuminates inequities around gender, poverty, and institutional authority. Female patients were especially vulnerable to diagnoses that pathologized “excess” emotion; labels like “envy” could echo moral judgments. Naming and displaying patients as types participated in a public culture of stigma. Yet by removing sensational props and focusing on dignified likeness, Géricault complicates the asymmetry between the medical gaze and the subject’s personhood.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
        Esquirol’s concept of “monomania” posited a circumscribed delusional fixation amid otherwise intact faculties. “Obsessive envy” would have been read as a single-idea disorder. Contemporary frameworks would map aspects of this presentation to delusional disorder, jealous type (Othello syndrome), or to pathological jealousy arising from mood, substance, or neurocognitive disorders. Etiology is multifactorial: genetic susceptibility, dopaminergic dysregulation in psychotic-spectrum conditions, fronto-striatal or limbic dysfunction, and psychosocial stressors (loss, deprivation, intimate-partner conflict) can all precipitate or amplify jealous delusions.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
        The work visualizes non-specific markers: a tightened mouth, furrowed brow, oblique gaze, and guarded posture that read as suspicion or rumination. The sallow skin and deep-set eyes may suggest age, fatigue, or institutional hardship rather than discrete pathology. While such features are not diagnostic, the image carefully encodes vigilance and inwardness—themes consistent with persecutory or jealous ideation in clinical descriptions—thus functioning as visual symptomatology within an early 19th-century taxonomy.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment<br>
        In the 1820s, “moral treatment” (structured routines, labor, calm environments) coexisted with coercive methods such as seclusion, cold baths, and sedatives; pharmacological antipsychotics did not yet exist. Current evidence-based care for delusional jealousy emphasizes risk assessment, psychoeducation, and antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone, olanzapine); SSRIs or CBT may assist when obsessive-compulsive features or mood disorders are present. Family interventions and safeguarding are crucial, given elevated risks of interpersonal violence and self-harm in untreated cases.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
        Poverty, limited legal rights for women, widowhood or social isolation, and precarious labor layered vulnerability in Restoration-era France. Institutional crowding and public stigma further shaped trajectories of illness and recovery. Analogous determinants persist today: housing instability, intimate-partner dynamics, alcohol misuse, and barriers to mental-health access can precipitate or perpetuate delusional jealousy, underscoring the need for integrated social and clinical responses.</p>
