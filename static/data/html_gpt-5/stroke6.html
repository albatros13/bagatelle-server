        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The work presents a sequence of self-portrait studies rendered in bold, expressionistic lines. Because the exact authorship is not specified here, this analysis treats the maker as an anonymous modern artist aligned with European Expressionism, a movement that privileged internal states over naturalistic description. The serial format—multiple versions of the same face across media—invites comparison and close reading of evolving gesture, line, and facial asymmetry.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        The prints and drawings appear consistent with mid–to–late twentieth‑century studio practice, when artists frequently used lithography and ink to probe identity through iterative self-portraiture. This was also a period when biomedicine increasingly influenced public consciousness. Widespread awareness of cerebrovascular disease, expanding hospital systems, and the emergence of rehabilitation disciplines formed the backdrop against which artists could reflect on illness, recovery, and embodiment.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The central icon is the artist’s head, repeated frontally and in profile. Heavy cross‑hatching, occluding blocks of black, and emphatic contours symbolically encode psychic weight and physical struggle. Eyes that alternately open and close, a mouth that sags or tightens, and a head sometimes intersected by a diagonal tool or bar suggest vulnerability of the face as a site of selfhood. Repetition itself functions iconographically: each iteration becomes a time‑slice, a record of fluctuating capacity and mood that mirrors the episodic course of neurological disease.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        Line dominates: thick, fractured strokes create a scaffold of planes, while thinner, tremulous marks imply instability. Value contrast is stark—deep blacks compress the visual field, forcing attention onto the furrowed brow, nasolabial fold, and jaw. Compositional asymmetry and cropping heighten tension; rhythm arises from recursive mark‑making that oscillates between control and release. The economy of means—black media on light ground—produces high expressive yield, a hallmark of expressionist portraiture.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Stroke disproportionately affects individuals with limited access to preventive care, rapid transport, and rehabilitation. The work’s anxious tactility can be read as testimony to these inequities: the body becomes a terrain shaped by structural factors such as income, education, and geography. For artists, additional inequities include precarious employment, lack of health insurance, and disability stigma, all of which can constrain recovery and creative continuity.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        Stroke is an acute neurologic injury caused by interrupted cerebral blood flow. About 85% are ischemic (arterial occlusion from thrombosis or embolism), while the remainder are hemorrhagic (intracerebral or subarachnoid bleeding). Major risk factors include hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and age. Pathophysiologically, ischemia triggers an ischemic core surrounded by a penumbra of hypoperfused yet salvageable tissue; timely reperfusion aims to rescue this penumbra.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Several visual cues in the portraits resemble clinical signs. Facial asymmetry and drooping of the lower face suggest seventh‑nerve involvement from a supranuclear lesion. The closed or downcast eye in some iterations might imply gaze palsy or fatigue, while compressed space on one side of the head may metaphorically evoke hemispatial neglect. Line quality—irregular, tremulous, or abruptly broken—can reflect motor impairment, proximal shoulder weakness, or non‑dominant hand usage after hemiparesis. Repetitive recalibration of contours evokes apraxia, the difficulty performing learned movements despite preserved strength. These readings remain interpretive but fit known post‑stroke phenomenology.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Contemporary acute management emphasizes rapid recognition (e.g., FAST/BE‑FAST), neuroimaging, and reperfusion. Intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours for eligible ischemic strokes and mechanical thrombectomy for large‑vessel occlusion within extended windows improve outcomes. Blood pressure optimization, antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, lipid lowering, and smoking cessation are key for secondary prevention. Rehabilitation—physical, occupational, and speech‑language therapy—drives neuroplastic recovery; evidence supports intensive, task‑specific practice such as constraint‑induced movement therapy. Art‑based therapies can augment mood, motivation, and visuospatial re‑training, offering a path by which the act of drawing itself becomes therapeutic.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Time to definitive care depends on emergency services availability, proximity to a stroke center, transportation, language access, and bystander recognition—factors unevenly distributed across communities. Chronic risk factors cluster with poverty, food insecurity, environmental exposures, and psychosocial stress. Post‑acute outcomes are shaped by insurance coverage, caregiver networks, and accessible housing. The portraits’ persistent self‑scrutiny can be read as resistance to these determinants: a claim to visibility and agency despite structural vulnerability.
