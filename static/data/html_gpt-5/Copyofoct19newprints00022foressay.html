        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The image belongs to the tradition of late medieval European medical illustration often known as the “Wound Man.” These sheets were copied by anonymous scribes and illuminators working for surgeons and physicians, especially in German- and Italian-speaking regions. While individual artists are rarely identified, the motif appears in surgical handbooks associated with figures such as Guy de Chauliac, Johannes de Ketham, and later Hans von Gersdorff. The purpose was didactic: to present, in one glance, the spectrum of traumatic and medical conditions a practitioner might encounter.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        Emerging in the 14th–15th centuries and persisting into the early print era, the Wound Man reflects a Europe shaped by endemic warfare, urbanization, and recurrent epidemics such as plague. Surgical practice was largely the domain of barber-surgeons, organized in guilds and often trained through apprenticeship rather than universities. Knowledge circulated in Latin and increasingly in vernacular manuscripts and early printed books. While dissection was becoming more common in some centers, humoral theory still framed diagnosis and therapy. The sheet’s crowded marginal text indexes injuries, treatments, and prognoses, fusing scholastic lists with practical battlefield experience.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The frontal male figure, arms outstretched, functions as an encyclopedic index. Arrows, swords, and clubs signify penetrating and blunt trauma; gashes with trickling red ink symbolize hemorrhage; animal imagery at the feet evokes bites and envenomation. Numbered labels link specific lesions to textual recipes or prognostic notes. The exposed viscera, urethral region, and cranial lesions signal areas of particular surgical concern—trepanation, hernias, kidney or bladder stones, and gut wounds. Rather than an individualized portrait, the figure is an allegorical corpus of risks in medieval life.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        Line dominates: fine contouring defines anatomy while rubricated numbers and red hatching dramatize bleeding. The composition employs hierarchical emphasis—injuries are exaggerated in scale to serve legibility and mnemonic force. The planar, icon-like stance and shallow modeling recall manuscript illumination more than naturalistic anatomy. Balance is achieved through bilateral distribution of wounds, guiding the reader’s eye from head to foot in a didactic sequence. Text-image integration, with marginal glosses keyed to the body, anticipates the visual pedagogy of early printed surgical manuals.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        The sheet registers inequities in medieval healthcare. University-trained physicians, versed in theory, often avoided manual surgery, leaving invasive care to lower-status barber-surgeons. Access to skilled treatment varied by class, guild membership, and urban resources. Literacy barriers shaped who could use such diagrams; vernacular captions widened access, but women and the rural poor remained underserved. Battlefield and craft injuries disproportionately affected soldiers and artisans, while charity hospitals offered limited, often palliative, care.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        The image catalogs trauma (penetrating arrow and sword wounds, lacerations, fractures), cranial injuries requiring trepanation, soft-tissue injuries, envenomation, and urogenital complaints suggestive of urinary calculi. Medieval etiologies blended natural causes—weapon force, contaminated water, animal poison—with humoral imbalance, miasma, and astral influences. Modern medicine would frame these conditions in biomechanical terms (kinetic energy and tissue disruption), microbiology (bacterial contamination leading to sepsis), and toxicology (venom effects). The abdominal and thoracic wounds imply risks of peritonitis, pneumothorax, and hemorrhagic shock.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Visual signifiers include active arterial bleeding, gaping wound edges, embedded projectiles, contusions, edema-like swellings, and possible buboes. Cranial lacerations suggest skull fracture or dural breach; thoracoabdominal penetrations imply organ injury; limb wounds risk neurovascular compromise; peri-genital markings suggest stone disease or urethral trauma. Animal imagery signals envenomation with neurotoxic or hemotoxic sequelae. Together they map a spectrum from localized tissue damage to systemic infection and shock.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Historical care emphasized hemostasis (digital pressure, ligature, cautery), wound cleansing with wine or vinegar, debridement, and suturing of clean margins. Fractures were reduced and splinted; trepanation relieved depressed fractures or intracranial pressure; cauterization addressed bleeding and potential poison; for urinary stones, perineal lithotomy was a last resort. Antisepsis and anesthesia were rudimentary, so mortality from sepsis and hemorrhage was high. Modern evaluation would prioritize rapid hemorrhage control, broad-spectrum antibiotics, tetanus prophylaxis, imaging, and damage-control surgery—revealing both the practical ingenuity and limitations of medieval methods.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        War, hazardous crafts, and poor urban sanitation increased risk for trauma and infection. Malnutrition impaired wound healing. Guild regulations shaped who could practice and who received care; travel and trade facilitated spread of pathogens and exotic toxins. Climate fluctuations and poverty intensified vulnerability. These determinants, more than individual frailty, explain the encyclopedic reach of the Wound Man as a visual risk register for medieval bodies.
