        <h1>Anathomia: Muscle man in red and black, front view</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        The image belongs to the “Muscle man” tradition in medieval anatomical manuscripts, most likely produced by an anonymous Italian illuminator working in the university milieu associated with Bologna and Padua. Its textual lineage traces to Mondino de Luzzi’s Anathomia (completed in 1316), a foundational handbook copied widely in the fifteenth century. Rather than a named artist, this sheet reflects a craft tradition of medical scribes and rubricators who synthesized scholastic anatomy with workshop drawing conventions.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        The sheet dates to the later Middle Ages or early Renaissance, when European universities consolidated a curriculum based on Latin translations of Greco-Arabic medicine. Dissection was episodic but increasingly institutionalized—often tied to winter public anatomies using bodies of executed criminals. Galenic theory dominated, mediated by Arabic authorities such as Avicenna and Averroes, while local surgeons relied on practical manuals. The image predates Vesalius (1543) and thus exemplifies a world in which anatomy served mnemonic and didactic ends more than empirical naturalism. It participates in a manuscript culture just before print transformed both illustration and anatomical authority.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The frontal, nearly hieratic stance echoes medieval “diagram” figures—the Zodiac Man, Bloodletting Man, and Wound Man—where the body is a map for knowledge. Red and white striations mark “flesh” and connective tissues rather than precise origin–insertion anatomy. The protruding tongue and emphasized eyes evoke the living demonstrator, a “speaking” body that teaches; open hands present the palms as sites for surgical skill and pulse-taking. Genitalia, navel, and nipples are included not as erotic detail but as locational anchors for proportion and pedagogical orientation.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        Line is paramount: contour outlines the figure while parallel hatching constructs muscle masses as decorative patterns. Color is limited to red, black, and occasional flesh tints, producing high contrast that improves legibility in candlelit lecture halls. The symmetry, frontality, and flat ground reduce illusionism, keeping attention on labeled or implied regions. Compared to later Vesalian plates, modeling is schematic; yet rhythm, repetition, and balance yield a clear visual hierarchy from trunk to limbs, performing the cognitive work of categorization central to scholastic pedagogy.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Access to this knowledge was restricted to Latin-literate clerics, physicians, and urban elites. Bodies used for anatomy were commonly those of the poor or criminalized, reflecting asymmetric power over the dead. Women’s bodies are largely absent from these cycles, limiting gynecologic understanding. Gatekeeping through Latin manuscripts and university charters maintained regional and class disparities in surgical training, contributing to uneven medical care between urban and rural populations.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        Although the image is not a disease portrait, it offers a platform to discuss skeletal muscle disorders that such a diagram tried to systematize. Inflammatory myopathies (polymyositis, dermatomyositis) are autoimmune conditions driven by T-cell–mediated muscle fiber injury or complement-mediated vascular damage. Infectious myositis can arise from bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) or parasites (Trichinella). Metabolic myopathies stem from genetic defects in glycogen or lipid metabolism (e.g., McArdle disease, CPT II deficiency). Rhabdomyolysis reflects acute myocyte breakdown from trauma, exertion, toxins, or drugs, releasing myoglobin. Age-related sarcopenia features multifactorial etiology—anabolic resistance, endocrine change, inflammation, and reduced activity.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Clinical signifiers include proximal muscle weakness (difficulty rising, climbing), myalgia, and fatigability. Dermatomyositis adds heliotrope rash and Gottron papules. Laboratory findings: elevated creatine kinase, aldolase, and transaminases; myoglobinuria in rhabdomyolysis. Imaging (MRI STIR sequences) highlights edema; EMG reveals myopathic potentials; biopsy demonstrates fiber necrosis, endomysial inflammation, or storage vacuoles, depending on etiology. These measurable signs refine the generalized musculature that the medieval figure abstracts.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Inflammatory myopathies are treated with corticosteroids and steroid-sparing agents (methotrexate, azathioprine); IVIG or biologics are options for refractory disease. Infectious myositis requires targeted antimicrobials and drainage if abscess forms. Rhabdomyolysis is a fluids-first emergency to prevent kidney injury, with correction of electrolytes and removal of offending agents. Metabolic myopathies rely on dietary modification, avoidance of triggers, and, in select lysosomal disorders, enzyme replacement. For sarcopenia, progressive resistance training, adequate protein intake (1.0–1.2 g/kg/day, higher if frail), and vitamin D repletion are core.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Muscle health is shaped by food security, occupational load, environmental toxins, and access to supervised rehabilitation. In both medieval and modern contexts, poverty constrains high-quality protein intake and rest, while hazardous labor increases injury risk. Gendered caregiving burdens reduce time for exercise; racialized inequities in healthcare limit early recognition of myopathies. Urban design and safe public space further condition physical activity and recovery.
