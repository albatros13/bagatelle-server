        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>
        The image evokes the practice of artist Laura Ferguson, whose work translates her own medical scans into drawings and prints that render the skeleton as an intimate self-portrait. Ferguson’s studio inquiry bridges anatomy, radiology, and autobiography, often linked to her ongoing “Visible Skeleton” explorations. Rather than treating the body as clinical specimen, she reclaims it as subjectivity, turning diagnostic data into poetic form. The piece’s gold-on-black tonalities and emphasis on the thoracic spine situate it within a lineage of artists who use biomedical technologies to visualize interiority while foregrounding lived experience with spinal curvature.
        </p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>
        This work arises from the late twentieth to early twenty-first century moment when CT/MRI imaging, digital post-processing, and DICOM archives transformed how bodies are visualized. The period saw disability arts gaining visibility alongside critical discourses of patient agency and bioethics. Artists increasingly collaborated with anatomists and radiologists, while museums and medical schools fostered cross-disciplinary programs. In this context, a personal anatomy—especially one marked by scoliosis—becomes both an archival record and a counter-history to objectifying medical gazes, reframing the clinical image as embodied testimony.
        </p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
        <p>
        Gold functions as a sign of preciousness and alchemical transformation: the body’s perceived “imperfection” is transmuted into value. Against the black ground, the ribs glow like a constellation, suggesting night-sky cosmology and the mystery of interior life. The spiral curvature of the spine implies time, growth, and adaptive resilience. Transparency—an icon of radiological seeing—becomes a metaphor for vulnerability and self-knowledge, while the ribcage’s cage-like rhythm both protects and confines, articulating the paradox of pain and protection that structures many chronic conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>
        The composition exploits chiaroscuro, with luminous linework that modulates from filament-thin tracery to fog-like veils. Repetition and rhythm are established by the ribs’ arcs, generating movement across the field. Negative space is active, allowing the eye to complete absent structures. The partial, oblique vantage produces foreshortening and a dynamic diagonal thrust. Diffuse edges mimic scatter in radiographic imaging, while concentrated highlights emphasize nodal points—vertebral bodies and costovertebral joints—thus merging expressive gesture with recognizable anatomical landmarks.
        </p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>
        Spinal disorders intersect with inequities in access to screening, specialist referral, and advanced imaging. Gendered biases have historically led to the minimization of musculoskeletal pain in women and girls. Insurance coverage and geographic distance to tertiary centers determine who receives bracing, physiotherapeutic instruction, or surgical consultation. Within art institutions, disabled bodies have been underrepresented or aestheticized without voice. By aestheticizing her own anatomy, the artist counters erasure, advancing disability visibility and patient-authored narratives in spaces traditionally shaped by biomedical authority.

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>
        Scoliosis is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine defined by a lateral curvature of at least 10 degrees (Cobb angle) with vertebral rotation. The most common form, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), affects roughly 2–3% of adolescents, with a higher prevalence in females and in those with progressive curves. Etiology in AIS is multifactorial and incompletely understood; proposed contributors include polygenic inheritance, asymmetries in vertebral growth modulation, neuromuscular control, connective-tissue traits, and hormonal influences. Other types include congenital scoliosis (vertebral segmentation anomalies), neuromuscular scoliosis (e.g., in cerebral palsy), and adult degenerative scoliosis arising from disc and facet degeneration. Thoracic curves can alter rib orientation and thoracic volume, subtly affecting respiratory mechanics.
        </p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>
        Clinically, asymmetry may appear as shoulder elevation, scapular prominence, waistline discrepancy, or a thoracic “rib hump” accentuated on the Adam’s forward-bend test. Radiographs quantify the Cobb angle and vertebral rotation (e.g., Nash-Moe), while skeletal maturity is gauged by Risser staging. In the image, the splayed ribs and serpentine thoracic column visually register rotation and wedging, the very hallmarks that produce surface asymmetry. The glow and overlap of arcs echo how ribs derange around a rotated spine, translating pathophysiology into a legible visual motif.
        </p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>
        Management depends on curve magnitude, pattern, and growth potential. Observation is typical for curves under 20 degrees in growing adolescents. Bracing (e.g., Boston or Rigo-Chêneau) aims to slow progression for curves around 20–40 degrees when skeletal maturity is incomplete, and targeted physiotherapy such as Schroth-based exercises can improve postural control and quality of life. Surgery is considered for progressive curves typically exceeding 45–50 degrees, with posterior spinal fusion and pedicle-screw instrumentation the standard. In select skeletally immature patients, vertebral body tethering offers growth-guided correction. Adult care emphasizes pain control, core conditioning, bone health, and, when necessary, decompression/fusion for stenosis or severe deformity.
        </p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>
        Early detection is shaped by school screening policies, primary-care continuity, and health literacy. Insurance status influences timely access to orthotists, physical therapists, and high-volume spinal deformity centers. Rural residence can limit specialist care; racial and socioeconomic disparities affect referral patterns and surgical outcomes. Environmental factors—nutrition, physical activity, and ergonomic supports—mediate symptom burden over time. Psychosocial supports, disability accommodations in education/work, and community arts-health programs can mitigate stigma and improve adherence, reframing treatment as collaborative rather than coercive.
