        <h2>Old Market Woman (Hellenistic)</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>
        Attributed to an unknown Hellenistic Greek sculptor, the figure commonly called “Old Market Woman” survives in Roman marble copies after a Greek original, probably of the late 2nd or early 1st century BCE. The work belongs to the broader Hellenistic tradition that shifted attention from idealized youths and gods to marginalized, aging, and working-class subjects. It stands within an urban Greek milieu but circulated in Roman collecting contexts, where such vivid genre figures were prized for their realism and moralizing overtones.
        </p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>
        The Hellenistic period (323–31 BCE) fostered cosmopolitan cities, market economies, and diverse patronage networks. Artists explored pathos, psychological specificity, and social variety. Genre sculpture depicting vendors, fishermen, dwarfs, and elderly women reflected a world in which theatricality, festival life, and commerce intersected. Roman elites later acquired or commissioned copies, reframing these images as learned conversation pieces that embodied Greek paideia while also commenting on age, poverty, and the body’s vulnerability.
        </p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
        <p>
        The figure carries a basket and fowl, suggesting a vendor en route to a festival. The ivy wreath often seen on versions of this type signals Dionysiac associations—either a devotee, supplier to a Bacchic rite, or a satirical counterpart to ideal revellers. Exposed breast, disheveled drapery, and forward stoop emphasize age and labor, contrasting sacred festivity with everyday hardship. The iconography thus fuses sacred economy (offerings for Dionysus) with genre realism, inviting viewers to consider ritual as sustained by the toil of the poor and elderly.
        </p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>
        The sculpture’s compositional dynamism relies on an oblique S-curve, with a pronounced forward pitch that breaks Classical symmetry. Deep-drilled folds, undercut shadowing, and differentiated textures (stringy hair, thin cloth, rough basketry) heighten verisimilitude. The rhythm of the drapery directs the eye from the bowed head to the load-bearing arm, reinforcing narrative movement. Pathos is crafted through anatomical specificity—sinewy neck, slack flesh, and bony knees—demonstrating the Hellenistic interest in the particular, not the ideal. Traces of ancient polychromy on comparable works suggest lifelike surface effects were once even more vivid.
        </p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>
        The subject embodies intersecting inequities of age, gender, and class. Elderly women occupied precarious niches in ancient urban economies, often as vendors lacking protections enjoyed by male guilds or elite households. The sculpture also encodes a classed gaze: carved for affluent patrons, it aestheticizes hardship while transforming the laboring body into moral lesson and collectible curiosity. Its Roman afterlife further extends a hierarchy in which Greek realism became a marker of elite taste, detached from the real conditions of those represented.
        </p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>
        The body is rendered with signs consistent with age-related musculoskeletal disease. The thoracic kyphosis suggested by the rounded upper back and forward head posture aligns with degenerative vertebral changes common in later life, potentially from osteoporosis or cumulative load-bearing. Prominent clavicles, sunken cheeks, and thin limbs imply sarcopenia and possible chronic energy deficiency. Apparent tooth loss (parted lips, collapsed perioral structure in some versions) would be typical of premodern dentition affected by wear, caries, and limited dental care. Etiologies include malnutrition, vitamin D and calcium deficits, repetitive strain from carrying goods, and chronic inflammation of joints.
        </p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>
        Observable signifiers include forward-flexed spine, asymmetric weight shift, and arm abduction restricted by the basket load—all congruent with osteoarthritic compensation. The drooping shoulder girdle and visible rib relief suggest reduced soft tissue and muscle wasting. Facial laxity and open mouth evoke edentulism; combined with stooped gait, they construct a holistic portrait of frailty. While these are sculptural choices rather than a clinical record, they align with paleopathological markers of kyphosis and occupational stress lesions documented in archaeological skeletal samples.
        </p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>
        In antiquity, management of spinal curvature drew on Hippocratic traction, bracing, heat applications, massage, and exercise, alongside analgesics such as willow-bark decoctions and wine. Dietetic regimens prescribed by Hippocratic and later Galenic physicians emphasized balanced humors, moderate activity, and restorative foods—though access was class-dependent. Modern evidence-based care for age-related kyphosis and osteoarthritis includes physiotherapy (postural training, core strengthening), pain control, vitamin D and calcium optimization, and, in severe osteoporosis with vertebral fractures, antiresorptive therapy. Prevention hinges on nutrition, workload modification, and safe lifting.

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>
        Poverty, lifelong manual labor, and insecure food supply elevate risk for skeletal degeneration and malnutrition. Gendered labor roles limited women’s access to protein-rich diets and medical attention. Urban crowding increased exposure to infectious disease and reduced sunlight in dense neighborhoods, exacerbating vitamin D deficiency. Seasonal festival economies demanded intense physical effort in short bursts, further stressing aging bodies. The sculpture crystallizes these determinants, making social structure legible on the body.
