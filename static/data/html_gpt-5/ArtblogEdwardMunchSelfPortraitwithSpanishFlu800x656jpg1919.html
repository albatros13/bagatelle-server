        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            Edvard Munch, a Norwegian painter aligned with Symbolism and a precursor to Expressionism, explored psychological states and the body’s vulnerability throughout his career. In works from the 1890s onward, he linked illness, grief, and anxiety to modern life. The painting commonly titled Self-Portrait with the Spanish Flu (1919) belongs to his late period, when he lived near Oslo. It fuses autobiography with broader cultural memory, using the artist’s own body as a site for investigating disease, mortality, and convalescence—recurring preoccupations across his oeuvre.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            Created during the devastating 1918–1919 influenza pandemic and in the wake of World War I, the work sits at the intersection of medical catastrophe and social upheaval. Norway, though neutral in the war, experienced significant influenza waves with excess mortality and public-health strain. Contemporaneous reports noted quarantines, closures, and ad hoc nursing systems. The era’s medical science was on the cusp of virology: pathogens were presumed bacterial by many; antibiotics did not yet exist. In this context, the painting registers a culture newly aware of airborne contagion and of the fragility of modern urban societies.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>
            The interior, with its sparse furnishings and distant doorway, evokes isolation and convalescence. Sickly greens and grays dominate the palette, connoting stale air and febrile malaise, while streaks of red and ocher suggest fever flush and inflammation. The figure’s forward tilt and heavy coat imply both chill and fatigue, staples of fever narratives from the period. Books and a tabletop receding into the background allude to interrupted work and the suspended tempo of illness. The image thus encodes a personal sickroom as a symbol for a world held in abeyance by pandemic forces.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            Expressive brushwork, thickly laid and directional, describes form while simultaneously externalizing sensation. Contour lines remain open, allowing the ground to press forward, collapsing depth and creating a claustrophobic, compressed space. Color temperature contrasts—chilled blues/greens against ruddy facial notes—produce an optical tension that reads as fever alternating with chill. The composition centers the near bust-length figure, cropped tightly, so that gesture and gaze dominate over narrative detail. Rhythmically repeated strokes across wall, face, and garment unify the field, embodying breathy, irregular pulsations akin to labored respiration.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            The 1918–1919 pandemic magnified inequities linked to crowding, poverty, occupation, and access to care. Mortality was disproportionately high among the working poor, Indigenous communities in several regions, and populations with malnutrition or tuberculosis. Information control and limited public-health infrastructure compounded risks. The painting’s solitary sickroom hints at differential capacities to isolate, rest, and recover—privileges unevenly distributed. It also indexes the gendered and classed burdens of caregiving, largely invisible here but historically borne by nurses, domestic workers, and family members.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            The “Spanish flu” is now known to have been caused by an influenza A(H1N1) virus with avian lineage contributions. Transmission occurs primarily via respiratory droplets and aerosols, with fomites playing a lesser role. After inhalation, the virus binds epithelial cells in the upper and, in severe cases, lower respiratory tract via sialic-acid receptors; rapid replication triggers innate immune responses. Excess mortality in 1918–1919 arose from a combination of viral pneumonia in some patients and secondary bacterial pneumonia (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus) in many others—untreatable at the time due to the pre-antibiotic era.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Contemporary clinical descriptions emphasized abrupt fever, myalgia, headache, cough, and profound fatigue; severe cases exhibited cyanosis and respiratory distress. The painting translates such symptomatology into visual cues: the mottled, heated coloration of the face suggests fever; the slumped posture and dulled eyes convey asthenia; enveloping garments imply chill. The compressed space and scant daylight read as the sensory world of isolation. While not a clinical document, the image faithfully mirrors reported experiences of influenza sufferers and the psychic weight of breathlessness and protracted convalescence.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            In 1919, treatment was largely supportive: rest, hydration, nutrition, and nursing care. Oxygen therapy was limited; antibiotics for bacterial superinfection were unavailable; antivirals did not exist. Some patients received high-dose salicylates, now suspected to have worsened outcomes in certain cases. Non-pharmaceutical interventions—quarantine, masking, ventilation, and public closures—were central. In contrast, contemporary management includes neuraminidase or polymerase inhibitors for early cases, broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected secondary bacterial pneumonia, and evidence-based respiratory support, reminding us how therapeutic horizons shape both survival and cultural memory.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Outcomes are mediated by housing density, occupational exposure, nutrition, comorbidities, health literacy, and trust in public institutions. Wartime troop movements, constrained resources, and uneven communication accelerated spread and confusion in 1918–1919. The sickroom here becomes a microcosm of these determinants: isolation presumes space; recovery presumes sustenance; and the prospect of care depends on networks—factors unequally distributed across class, region, and ethnicity during the pandemic.
