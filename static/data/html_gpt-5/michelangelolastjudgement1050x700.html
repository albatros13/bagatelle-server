<h1>Michelangelo, The Last Judgment</h1>

<h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
<p>Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564), the Florentine master of sculpture, painting, and architecture, executed The Last Judgment as a monumental fresco on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. Working largely alone, he brought to the project the sculptor’s eye for mass and tension, translating marble-like bodies into paint. His deep knowledge of anatomy—acquired through study of classical statuary and direct observation of dissections—animates every figure with physiological plausibility and kinetic force.</p>

<h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
<p>Painted between 1536 and 1541 under Pope Paul III, the fresco emerged in a climate marked by the trauma of the 1527 Sack of Rome, the religious fractures of the Protestant Reformation, and Catholic renewal that would culminate in the Council of Trent. Rome’s courtly humanism coexisted with anxieties about sin, judgment, plague, and the “French disease” (syphilis). The work addresses eschatological certainty while registering a culture grappling with reform, censorship, and the social strains of disease and war-driven migration.</p>

<h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
<p>At the center, Christ as judge unleashes a cosmic rotation that raises the saved and casts down the damned. Mary turns inward in intercessory restraint. Angels with trumpets (from Revelation) summon the dead, while below, Charon ferries the condemned and Minos presides over Hell—classical figures absorbed through Dante’s Divine Comedy. Saints are identified by attributes: Saint Bartholomew with flayed skin, Saint Catherine with her wheel, Saint Sebastian with arrows. The tangle of resurrecting bodies, some skeletal, some reconstituting, visualizes the reunion of body and soul. The serpent biting the groin of a sinner alludes to lust and, in a period haunted by venereal contagion, could be read as a moralized sign of sexual transgression and its corporeal consequences.</p>

<h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
<p>Formally, the fresco is a tour de force of late Renaissance and emergent Mannerist style. Michelangelo compresses space into a single, turbulent field, subordinating architecture to the vortex of bodies. The serpentinata twist, extreme foreshortening, and chiaroscuro model muscular volumes with sculptural clarity. Saturated azures and earth pigments orchestrate hierarchies of focus, while the rhythmic alternation of mass and void drives the eye in spirals, mirroring the theological rotation from salvation to damnation.</p>

<h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
<p>The reception history exposes power dynamics over bodies and vision. Critics within the Church decried the extensive nudity; after 1564 Daniele da Volterra added draperies to conform to new decorum standards, signaling institutional control over representation, modesty, and gendered visibility. The saved and damned encode a moral order tied to ecclesiastical authority, and the scarcity of individualized female protagonists underscores patriarchal hierarchies. Meanwhile, the conflation of sin with bodily corruption mirrors period stigmas placed on the poor, foreigners, sex workers, and the diseased, who were frequently policed and segregated.</p>

<h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
<p>Two disease frameworks inform period interpretation. First, plague—understood via miasma and divine wrath—recurred in sixteenth-century Italy; the mass resurrection scenes engage hopes of bodily restoration after epidemic death. Second, syphilis, newly rampant since the late fifteenth century, was attributed to sexual transmission but often embedded in moral discourse. Etiological models combined humoral imbalance with environmental and behavioral factors; without germ theory, explanations fused physiology and sin, shaping iconographic cues that link genital danger, decay, and punishment.</p>

<h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
<p>Michelangelo’s figures rarely exhibit discrete lesions; instead, pathology is allegorized. Emaciated resurrecting bodies suggest cachexia and sarcopenia reversed by divine fiat. The flayed skin of Saint Bartholomew foregrounds integument—the organ most visibly altered by disease—serving as a meditation on mortality and identity. In the damned, torsional postures and strained musculature evoke cramp, spasm, and asphyxial struggle, visual proxies for torment. The groin-directed serpent functions as a period signifier for venereal peril, resonating with contemporary fears of the “Great Pox.”</p>

<h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
<p>Therapeutics of the era were symptomatic and humoral: purgation, bloodletting, dietary regimen, and baths. For syphilis, physicians prescribed mercury inunctions and fumigations or the American-imported guaiacum wood; both had limited efficacy and significant toxicity. Plague interventions centered on quarantine, isolation hospitals (lazzaretti), and civic health boards. Religious responses—processions, vows, and the intercession of saints—coexisted with medical practice, reflecting a continuum of spiritual and corporeal care.</p>

<h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
<p>Urban crowding, war-displaced populations, poverty, and sex economies intensified contagion. Restricted access to learned medicine, moralized blame for disease, and the policing of marginalized groups shaped who suffered and how care was delivered. The fresco’s drama of judgment thus echoes real inequities: bodies were disciplined, segregated, or redeemed according to social rank, gendered expectations, and proximity to ecclesiastical and civic power.</p>
