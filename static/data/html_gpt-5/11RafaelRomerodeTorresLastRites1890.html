        <h1>Rafael Romero de Torres, Last Rites (1890)</h1>

        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</strong><br>
        Rafael Romero de Torres belonged to the notable Romero de Torres family of painters from Córdoba, Spain. Working in the final decades of the nineteenth century, he combined academic training with naturalist observation. His practice aligns with Spanish costumbrismo and social realism, in which local customs, humble interiors, and working-class subjects were treated with sober dignity and moral gravity.</p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</strong><br>
        Painted in 1890, the work emerges from a Spain negotiating modernization, uneven industrialization, and deep rural poverty. Catholic ritual structured communal life, especially around illness and death. Artists trained in Rome and Madrid often adopted an academic realist finish while addressing contemporary social questions—labor precarity, disease, and access to care—subjects keenly felt in Andalusia and other agrarian regions.</p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</strong><br>
        The scene depicts the Catholic sacrament of Extreme Unction (Anointing of the Sick), known colloquially as “last rites.” The priest’s embroidered cope, the acolyte’s red cassock, and the processional lanterns emphasize the sacred intrusion into a common home. Viaticum (Eucharist for the dying) is suggested by the vessel the priest carries. The diagonal of the rafters directs the eye to the prone patient; the open doorway and gathered mourners underscore transition—from life to death—and the social witness to suffering.</p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</strong><br>
        Romero de Torres uses a restrained, earthy palette and precise, truthful drawing. The composition balances horizontals—the pallet, tiled floor, and low table—against the vertical procession of clergy. Controlled chiaroscuro models figures without theatricality, amplifying documentary credibility. Textural contrasts—the rough masonry, coarse bedding, gleaming metal lanterns—heighten realism. The careful placement of discarded clothing and tools functions as a still life of labor, a narrative device anchoring biography in objects.</p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</strong><br>
        The patient lies on a makeshift straw pallet rather than a bed, indicating poverty. The proximity of family, the absence of a physician, and reliance on clerical care reflect inequitable access to medical services in rural Spain. The painting quietly critiques structural disparities: cramped housing, limited sanitation, and the economic vulnerability of manual workers more exposed to injury and infectious disease.</p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</strong><br>
        The bandaged head, supine posture, and ashen complexion suggest severe cranial trauma—possibly from a workplace accident (construction or agricultural impact). In the late 19th century, traumatic brain injury (TBI) from falls or blows was common among laborers. Without neuroimaging or antibiotics, complications such as intracranial hemorrhage, skull fracture, or secondary infection (meningitis) carried high mortality. Alternative readings include delirium from systemic infection (e.g., tuberculosis), yet the explicit head bandage points most plausibly to acute trauma.</p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</strong><br>
        Visual cues include pallor, diaphoresis implied by damp cloths, and the patient’s flaccid right hand suggesting weakness or reduced consciousness. The tightly wrapped cranial dressing implies laceration or attempted hemostasis. The uncovered torso allows the artist to register emaciation and shallow breathing. On the floor, labor garments and a tool signal occupational etiology; the clustered attendants and solemn ritual signify medical futility and imminent death.</p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment</strong><br>
        Contemporary management of severe head injury (circa 1890) would have centered on rest, pressure dressings, purgatives or opiates for pain, and, in urban centers, antiseptic surgery inspired by Lister. In a modest household like this one, options were limited: cleansing with available antiseptics (carbolic acid when accessible), cold compresses, and prayerful vigil. Modern care would prioritize airway protection, hemodynamic stabilization, neuroimaging, and neurosurgical intervention for mass lesions, followed by infection prophylaxis and rehabilitation.</p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</strong><br>
        The interior’s material poverty indicates low income, overcrowding, and minimal sanitation—conditions increasing risk of injury and complicating recovery. Education and literacy levels likely limited health knowledge and navigation of care. Geographic isolation constrained timely access to surgeons or hospitals. Religious networks provided psychosocial support but could not substitute for structural health resources; the painting visualizes how class, occupation, and place collectively shape disease outcomes.</p>
