        <h1>Anatomia del corpo humano (800)</h1>

        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
        This plate is associated with Juan Valverde de Amusco’s Anatomia del corpo humano (Rome, 1556), a landmark Renaissance anatomy book. The imagery is commonly linked to designs by the Spanish artist Gaspar Becerra and to engravings produced in Rome, often attributed to Nicolas Beatrizet. While authorship of individual plates can be debated, the project exemplifies a collaboration between humanist physicians and skilled printmakers who translated dissection-based knowledge into legible images for scholars, surgeons, and students.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
        Mid-sixteenth-century Italy was a crucible for empirical anatomy following Andreas Vesalius’s De humani corporis fabrica (1543). The Catholic Reformation, the rise of universities, and increased access to cadavers (often those of executed criminals) enabled public dissections and the production of printed atlases. Valverde’s volume, published in Rome in 1556 and later translated and reprinted widely, inserted Iberian voices into an Italianate discourse, marrying classical ideals of the body with newly exacting observational methods.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
        The écorché figure—muscles exposed, holding his own flayed skin—blends scientific demonstration with moral allegory. The skin, shown as a drooping mantle with a mask-like face, evokes the memento mori tradition and recalls saints and myths of flaying (St. Bartholomew, Marsyas). The dagger signifies dissection and surgical craft while the rocky ground situates the scene in a timeless, natural theater. Lettered indices inscribed on muscles convert the body into a readable text, signaling the humanist ambition to “translate” nature.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
        The contrapposto stance derives from classical statuary, projecting harmony and ideal proportion even as the flesh is stripped away. Fine cross-hatching models volume and differential texture—taut fascia, striated muscle, and veiled dermis—while contour clarity preserves didactic legibility. The print medium amplifies reproducibility; each line is both aesthetic and epistemic, encoding depth, attachment points, and directional pull of muscle fibers. The figure’s turning head and reaching arm orchestrate a spiral rhythm that guides the viewer’s eye through anatomical hierarchies.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
        Renaissance anatomical knowledge was built on unequal access to bodies. Cadavers often came from the poor, the executed, and the socially marginalized, with scant consent by modern standards. The male body served as the normative template, obscuring gendered and racialized differences and reinforcing exclusions in medical education. Intellectual credit, too, was uneven: draftsmen and engravers were frequently subordinated to author-physicians, even when visual interpretation carried much of the explanatory burden.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
        Although the plate is not a disease portrait, it intersects with contemporaneous concerns about the “Great Pox” (syphilis), a condition that profoundly shaped sixteenth-century medicine. Today syphilis is known to be caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, transmitted predominantly through sexual contact and vertically in pregnancy. After entry via microabrasions, organisms disseminate hematogenously, producing staged manifestations: primary chancre, secondary rash and mucocutaneous lesions, latent periods, and tertiary gummatous, cardiovascular, or neurosyphilitic disease.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
        Early modern artists and physicians were attentive to syphilis’s cutaneous signs. In biomedical terms, notable markers include painless indurated chancre at inoculation, generalized nonpruritic rash (often involving palms and soles), condylomata lata, patchy “moth-eaten” alopecia, and mucous patches. Late disease may show aortitis with aneurysm, gummas in skin or bone, tabes dorsalis, and general paresis. While not illustrated here, the plate’s didactic emphasis on the integument and musculature echoes the diagnostic centrality of the skin to recognizing systemic illness.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment<br>
        Historically, therapy in Valverde’s milieu included mercury fumigation or inunction and guaiacum wood decoctions—regimens with toxicities and inconsistent efficacy. Modern evidence-based treatment is intramuscular benzathine penicillin G, with dosing determined by stage (e.g., single 2.4 million units for early syphilis; weekly doses for late latent). Alternatives for nonpregnant penicillin-allergic patients include doxycycline; desensitization is required in pregnancy and neurosyphilis. Management includes serologic follow-up, partner services, and screening for co-infections; clinicians anticipate the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction in early syphilis.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
        In the sixteenth century, urbanization, war, migration, and commercial sex facilitated transmission, while stigma, poverty, and limited access to care impeded treatment—dynamics mirrored in present-day disparities. Legal regimes governing dissection shaped who became “knowable” anatomically; similarly, contemporary surveillance and care infrastructures determine who is diagnosed and cured. Education, housing stability, structural racism, and gendered power relations remain decisive determinants of exposure risk, care-seeking, and outcomes.</p>
