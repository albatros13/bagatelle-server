        <h1>1</h1>

        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
        Anonymous medical illustrator working within a Persianate–Indo-Islamic and South Asian manuscript milieu, in which anatomical didactic images circulated alongside Unani (Galenic) and Ayurvedic treatises. The hand resembles traditions associated with copyists of Tashrīḥ (anatomy) texts as well as North Indian workshop practices documented in colonial and princely libraries. The work is best read as a studio product rather than an individualized authorial statement, reflecting collaborative scribe–painter knowledge production.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
        Such images proliferated from the late seventeenth through nineteenth centuries, when manuscript medicine bridged classical authorities (Galen, Avicenna, Sushruta, Charaka) and emergent print cultures. Courts, hakims, vaidyas, and early medical colleges exchanged diagrams to teach humoral physiology, obstetrics, and surgery. This period also saw intensified colonial collecting and translation, which reframed local medical epistemologies under imperial cataloguing systems and public health agendas.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
        The branching red conduits denote vasculature and, more broadly, vital “channels”—a concept resonant with Unani pathways of pneuma and Ayurvedic srotas. The centrally placed gravid uterus with fetus and placenta signals generative force and the clinical centrality of pregnancy. The seated, frontally posed body, palms open, reads as a schematic “every-body” rather than a portrait, emphasizing universality of interior anatomy. The fern-like cranial branches may symbolize cerebral vessels or the diffusion of life-spirit to the senses.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
        Line is paramount: crisp black contours and vermilion networks flatten three-dimensional anatomy into legible routes. Minimal modeling, planar fields, and a restricted palette enforce clarity over naturalism. Symmetry and bilateral mirroring organize the page, while rhythmic repetition of forked lines guides the eye from head to extremities. The figure’s compact, slightly crouched stance expands the abdominal field, optimizing space for the uterine vignette—an index of the didactic priority of gestation.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
        The image emerges from knowledge systems historically undervalued by Eurocentric narratives that privileged Vesalian realism. Manuscript labor—often anonymous, sometimes by artisans of lower social status—was de-individualized in catalogues. Women’s bodies were central to obstetric knowledge yet female practitioners had limited institutional authority; obstetric expertise was frequently extracted from midwifery communities without equivalent recognition, especially under colonial medical reforms.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
        Anchored by the uterine and vascular emphasis, a pertinent condition is postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)—excessive bleeding after childbirth and a leading cause of maternal mortality. Etiologies include uterine atony (most common), retained placental tissue, genital tract trauma, and coagulopathies. In humoral frameworks, PPH might be framed as disordered evacuation or imbalance of heat and moisture; biomedically, it reflects failure of myometrial contraction and impaired hemostasis at placental bed vessels.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
        Clinically, PPH presents with heavy vaginal bleeding, tachycardia, hypotension, pallor, dizziness, and decreasing urine output. On examination: a boggy, enlarged uterus suggests atony; clots and placental fragments indicate retention; lacerations cause persistent bleeding despite a firm uterus. The artwork’s arterial lattice surrounding the pelvis underscores the peril of insufficient uterine tone where spiral arteries remain uncompressed after placental separation.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment<br>
        Historically, midwives and hakims used uterine massage, herbal astringents, and positional strategies. Contemporary evidence-based care prioritizes active management of the third stage of labor, prophylactic oxytocin, prompt uterine massage, and escalation to additional uterotonics (misoprostol, ergometrine), tranexamic acid within three hours of birth, fluid resuscitation, and identification of retained tissue or trauma with surgical or interventional measures when needed (balloon tamponade, compression sutures, arterial ligation). Prevention includes antenatal anemia correction and readiness bundles in facilities.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
        PPH risk and outcomes are shaped by inequities in nutrition (iron deficiency), access to antenatal care, presence of skilled birth attendants, transport to facilities, blood availability, and respectful maternity care. Rural residence, poverty, and gender-based barriers to decision-making delay recognition and treatment. Structural legacies—such as the marginalization of midwifery and fragmentation between traditional and biomedical systems—continue to influence maternal survival.</p>
