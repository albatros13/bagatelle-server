<h2>Tonia Nneji, Faith and Worry (Detail), Acrylic and Oil on Canvas (2020, 48 × 48 inches)</h2>

<h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
<p>Tonia Nneji is a contemporary Nigerian painter based in Lagos whose practice foregrounds Black women’s bodies, pain, and healing. Drawing on familial histories and community narratives, she fuses devotional visual languages with everyday dress and textiles, creating scenes where intimacy, care, and vulnerability become forms of knowledge. While rooted in Nigeria’s dynamic art scene, her work engages a global conversation about gendered health, spiritual resilience, and the politics of visibility.</p>

<h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
<p>Created in 2020, this work emerges from a decade in which Lagos witnessed expanding contemporary art infrastructures and intensifying debates around women’s health, bodily autonomy, and religion. The time-frame also spans the stresses of economic precarity and the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposed fragile health systems and amplified domestic networks of care. Nneji’s canvases enter this moment by staging the home—cloth, lap, embrace—as a site where private suffering meets communal coping strategies and where faith and medicine coexist in uneasy dialogue.</p>

<h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
<p>The composition centers interlaced figures rendered in saturated indigo and midnight blues, a palette that conjures calm, night, and the internal body. Patterned wrappers reference West African wax prints and adire traditions; these fabrics often carry proverbial messages, social affiliations, or memorial functions. Drapery concentrated over the abdomen reads as an index of reproductive and pelvic pain while the close embrace signifies mutual aid and kinship nursing. The juxtaposition of devotional poise with domestic textile iconography translates spiritual vigilance and vigilance over the body into a single gesture.</p>

<h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
<p>Nneji’s hard-edged planes, restrained modeling, and deliberate contouring build sculptural figures from flat color. The interplay of cool and warm chroma—deep blues against a red-gold wrapper—creates optical heat around the torso, guiding attention to the body’s core. Negative space and overlapping silhouettes compress depth, intensifying intimacy. Rhythm arises from repeated shapes and patterned fabric, while balance is achieved via asymmetrical placement of limbs and cloth. The style synthesizes post-pop color blocking with devotional portraiture, translating affect through chromatic architecture rather than facial detail.</p>

<h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
<p>The work invokes inequities surrounding women’s pain: delayed diagnosis, dismissal by clinicians, cost barriers, and stigma around menstruation and infertility. In many contexts, Black women encounter structural and interpersonal bias in pain assessment and access to gynecologic surgery. For Nigerian patients, high out-of-pocket payments and uneven distribution of specialists compound delays. The painting’s title “Faith and Worry” speaks to the double bind of relying on prayer and family labor when medical systems are inaccessible or unresponsive.</p>

<h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
<p>The biomedical subtext references chronic pelvic pain disorders such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Endometriosis involves endometrium-like tissue located outside the uterus, driven by estrogen and sustained by inflammatory and immune dysregulation; genetic susceptibility and possibly environmental exposures contribute. Fibroids (leiomyomata) are benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus, also estrogen and progesterone responsive, shaped by genetic factors and, epidemiologically, by race and reproductive history. Both conditions can coexist and lead to heavy bleeding, anemia, pain, and fertility challenges.</p>

<h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
<p>Clinically, endometriosis presents with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, chronic pelvic pain, and sometimes subfertility; fibroids present with menorrhagia, pelvic pressure, urinary frequency, or pregnancy complications. In the artwork, the layered wrapper over the lower abdomen and protective body language visualize guarding—a pain behavior in which individuals shield affected regions. The cool-dark figure tones, contrasted with a hot red textile zone, operate as an expressive map of inflammation and visceral attention rather than literal anatomy.</p>

<h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
<p>Evidence-based management is multimodal. For endometriosis: NSAIDs for pain; hormonal suppression (combined oral contraceptives, progestins, levonorgestrel IUD, GnRH analogs/antagonists with add-back therapy) to reduce ectopic endometrial activity; and laparoscopic excision for refractory disease. For fibroids: watchful waiting, tranexamic acid or NSAIDs for bleeding, hormonal options (progestins, GnRH analogs/antagonists), uterine artery embolization, myomectomy for fertility preservation, and hysterectomy as definitive therapy. Adjunctive pelvic floor physical therapy, mental health support, and community care address chronic pain’s biopsychosocial dimensions.</p>

<h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
<p>Outcomes hinge on determinants such as income, insurance coverage, urban-rural proximity to specialists, transportation, gender norms shaping help-seeking, and religious interpretations of suffering. Structural racism and bias influence diagnostic timelines and analgesic access; information gaps about endometriosis in African populations limit early recognition. Community fabrics—the same cloths that appear in the painting—encode social belonging, yet also signal expectations around fertility and marriage that may deepen stigma when illness challenges reproductive plans.</p>
