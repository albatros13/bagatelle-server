        <h1>Side A: Ink line drawing of a seated figure showing seven subtle centres (cakra) and the main subtle veins (nadi)</h1>

        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
        The work is by an unidentified practitioner-illustrator within the South Asian yogic–tantric and medical (Ayurvedic/Siddha) traditions. Such diagrams circulated among lineages associated with Haṭha Yoga and Tantra, including Nāth and Kaula milieus, and were used pedagogically by yogis and healers (vaidya) to map the “subtle body” for practice and diagnosis.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
        Visual schemata of cakras and nāḍīs appear in Sanskrit and vernacular sources from the late medieval period onward and become especially common in manuscripts and teaching charts between the 17th and 19th centuries in North India and the Himalayan region. They mediate textual knowledge such as the Ṣaṭcakranirūpaṇa and later Haṭha Yoga compendia, translating esoteric physiology into a legible body plan. Under colonial modernity, such drawings met new audiences: collectors, ethnographers, and emerging print cultures that reframed yogic healing within debates about “native” medicine, religion, and science.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
        The central vertical channel (suṣumṇā) is flanked by ida and piṅgalā, often crossing at nodal points, with lotuses depicting cakras from the base to the crown. Petal counts, seed syllables, animal emblems, and yantric geometry encode mantric and cosmological correspondences. A coiled serpent at the base references kuṇḍalinī, whose ascent signals awakening. Annotated panels and small vignettes cue instructions, mantras, and correspondences (elements, deities, winds). The seated posture creates a human cosmogram: the body as microcosm mirroring macrocosmic order.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
        Executed as a linear, diagrammatic drawing, the work privileges contour and inscription over modeling. Frontal symmetry organizes attention along a strong vertical axis, while repeated circular motifs (lotuses) rhythmically punctuate space. Hierarchical scale elevates the central channel; peripheral motifs act as didactic marginalia. The restrained palette and reliance on text-image interlock fuse image and instruction, emphasizing clarity, proportional relationships, and mnemonic efficiency.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
        Historically, access to yogic–tantric knowledge was often gated by lineage, caste, and gender, producing inequities in who could learn, teach, or be treated. Colonial medicine’s privileging of biomedicine marginalized Ayurvedic and yogic therapeutics, shaping funding and institutional legitimacy into the 20th century. Today, global wellness economies circulate such imagery while often erasing its ritual and social contexts, raising questions about cultural appropriation, attribution, and the rights of knowledge-holding communities.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
        Within this framework, illness arises from disturbed flow of prāṇa through nāḍīs, blockages at cakras, and imbalance among the doṣas (vāta, pitta, kapha). Etiology includes faulty diet/lifestyle, seasonal and environmental influences, psychic agitation (rājas/tamas), and spiritual ignorance (avidyā). Psychophysiological stress disrupts breath and subtle winds, cascading into somatic and mental disorders. Contemporary science would reframe some mechanisms in terms of autonomic dysregulation, neuroendocrine stress axes, and inflammation, while respecting that the diagram encodes a distinct ontology rather than a one-to-one biomedical map.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
        Yogic and Ayurvedic semiotics read signs such as irregular breath, pulse qualities, heat or cold sensations, digestive disturbance, lethargy or agitation, and disturbed sleep as indicators of specific doṣic excess and prāṇic obstruction. Symbolically, “closed” petals or darkened zones in the diagram instruct the practitioner where to direct breath, mantra, and attention. Biomedical correlates may include altered heart-rate variability, elevated cortisol, or proinflammatory cytokines in chronic stress states; such parallels are heuristic and not asserted as strict equivalences.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment<br>
        Treatments integrate ethical discipline, diet, and staged practice: cleansing (ṣaṭkarman), postures (āsana), breath regulation (prāṇāyāma), and locks and seals (bandha, mudrā) to mobilize prāṇa along suṣumṇā. Mantra and meditation stabilize attention and re-pattern affect; herbal rasāyana and marma therapy may support recovery. Modern studies suggest that yoga-based regimens can improve autonomic balance (greater vagal tone), reduce perceived stress, and modestly lower inflammatory markers, though protocols and effect sizes vary and should complement, not replace, evidence-based care when indicated.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
        The efficacy and availability of such practices are shaped by poverty, caste marginalization, gendered labor, education, and access to safe spaces for practice. Urban crowding and environmental stressors can exacerbate dysregulation the diagram seeks to heal. Policy environments that underfund traditional practitioners or commodify practice without community reinvestment further entrench disparities. Culturally safe delivery—language access, respect for ritual, and protection of lineage knowledge—improves uptake and outcomes.</p>
