        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        This image belongs to the Tibetan Buddhist medical painting tradition associated with Sowa Rigpa, the “Science of Healing.” The cycle was commissioned in the late seventeenth century under the regent and scholar Desi Sangye Gyatso, whose Blue Beryl (Vaiḍūrya sngon po) commentary systematized medical knowledge. Anonymous artisan-painters trained in monastic and court workshops at Chagpori Medical College in Lhasa produced didactic scrolls (thangkas) to teach diagnosis and therapeutics to physician-monks (amchi). The painting is a collaborative artifact of textual exegesis, clinical pedagogy, and Buddhist cosmology.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        The composition reflects late 17th–early 18th century Tibet, a period of Geluk ascendancy and institutional consolidation of medicine. Chagpori, founded in 1696, fused Indian Ayurvedic legacies, Chinese, and Greco‑Islamic influences with local practice. Illustrated charts functioned as standardized curricula that knit together monastic learning, statecraft, and public health. They were mnemonic devices in a predominantly oral-scholastic culture, enabling consistent training across far-flung regions while embedding healing within Buddhist ethics and ritual.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The central figure maps “vulnerable points” (sites to avoid or treat with caution) along channels (tsa) that conduct winds (rlung), bile (mkhris‑pa), and phlegm (bad‑kan). The overlaid grid underscores measurement and proportional canon. Flanking figures expose organ schemata, spinal pathways, and nodal clusters; a small homunculus reinforces microcosm–macrocosm analogies. The head rosette and upper frieze with protective deities situate anatomy within a sacral cosmology, implying that corporeal integrity depends upon moral, ritual, and environmental balance. Color coding and seed-syllables cue humoral qualities, while inscriptions in Tibetan script label loci for moxibustion, cautery, bleeding, and palpation.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        Executed in mineral pigments with crisp contour lines, the painting employs planar space and symmetrical balance to deliver legibility. Repetition of dots and nodes creates rhythm, while the grid supplies a rationalizing scaffold akin to cartography. Flat color fields retain thangka conventions, yet the didactic clarity, precision labeling, and proportional mapping mark a hybrid between devotional image and scientific chart. Hierarchical framing—central anatomy below a deity frieze—visually mediates empirical observation through Buddhist authority.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Historically, access to medical education prioritized monastic and elite networks, marginalizing women and lay healers, though women practitioners existed in regional settings. Political centralization tied legitimacy to court institutions, shaping whose knowledge counted. In the modern era, Sowa Rigpa operates within uneven infrastructures, facing regulation, commercialization of formulas, and pressures from dominant biomedical systems. Intellectual property claims and tourist markets can obscure lineages and reduce complex therapeutics to exotic commodities, while diaspora and rural communities navigate limited clinical resources.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        Sowa Rigpa attributes illness to perturbations of the three nyes pa (rlung, mkhris‑pa, bad‑kan), triggered by diet, behavior, seasons, environment, pathogens, and moral-spiritual causes. The chart centers on traumatic and iatrogenic etiologies: damage to vital points can disrupt consciousness, respiration, fertility, or limb function. Vulnerable loci coincide with channel junctions, joint spaces, cranio‑cervical regions, and major cavities, warning that invasive or thermal therapies at these nodes can unbalance winds and humors and cause hemorrhage or paralysis.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Visual emphases on the temple, throat, axilla, cardiac region, umbilicus, groin, and popliteal fossa suggest danger zones now known to overlay neurovascular bundles (e.g., carotid bifurcation, brachial plexus, femoral triangle). Tibetan diagnostics—pulse, urine, and inquiry—would correlate pain, numbness, syncope, dyspnea, or cold extremities with injuries to these points. While the tsa‑rlung model is not isomorphic with modern anatomy, heuristic parallels can be drawn to connective‑tissue planes, autonomic hubs, and fascial septa that propagate symptoms along predictable paths.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Therapies include dietetics, behavioral modulation, compounded herbal-mineral formulas, and external methods: moxibustion, golden-needle cautery, cupping, massage (ku‑nye), and bloodletting. This plate functions primarily as a safety chart—where not to burn, cut, or puncture—and as a guide to indirect or distal stimulation. Contemporary anatomy-aware acupuncture standards echo this caution by avoiding arteries, nerves, and serous cavities. Treatment proceeds seasonally and constitutionally, aiming to calm winds, drain heat, or resolve phlegm while preserving vital points.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        High-altitude climates, pastoral diets rich in meat and butter, labor rhythms, and trade-route mobility shape disease patterns in Tibetan regions. Household heating, smoke exposure, and limited sanitation historically contributed to respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions. Access to trained amchi, availability of materia medica, and political borders influencing clinic licensing and pharmacopoeias remain decisive. Religious patronage can subsidize care, yet poverty, gendered caregiving, and migration stratify outcomes, framing why preventive guidance about vulnerable points was socially consequential.
