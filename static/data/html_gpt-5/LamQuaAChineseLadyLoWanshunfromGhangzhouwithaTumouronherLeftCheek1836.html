        <h1>Lam Qua A Chinese Lady Lo Wanshun from Ghangzhou with a Tumour on her Left Cheek (1836)</h1>
        <p>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe<br>
        The work is by Lam Qua (Guan Qiaochang), a Cantonese painter active in Guangzhou and Macao in the early to mid-19th century. Trained within the export-painting workshops and influenced by the British artist George Chinnery, Lam Qua adapted European portrait conventions—three‑quarter pose, modeling, and individualized likeness—into a Chinese studio practice. In the 1830s he collaborated with the American physician Peter Parker at the Canton Ophthalmic Hospital, producing a remarkable series of preoperative medical portraits that combine ethnographic record, clinical documentation, and commercial portraiture.</p>

        <p>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)<br>
        Painted in 1836, the image belongs to the late Qing dynasty under the Daoguang emperor, during the Canton System when foreign trade was restricted to Guangzhou. Missionary medicine was an emergent enterprise; Parker’s hospital (founded 1835) treated ocular disease and large tumors and used images to teach, solicit patronage, and demonstrate surgical efficacy. The blank studio backdrop evokes the regulated space of the “factories” district and the new clinical gaze taking shape before the advent of anesthesia (1846) and antisepsis (1860s), situating the portrait at a pivotal moment in global medical history.</p>

        <p>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography<br>
        The sitter’s regulated pose, folded hands, and monochrome ground highlight the facial mass as the picture’s iconographic center. Costume—blue robe with black trim, ornamental hairpins, and lotus shoes—indexes gendered respectability and the urban culture of the Pearl River Delta. The wooden bench anchors the scene in domestic familiarity while the austere emptiness reads as quasi-clinical space. The painting thus frames illness not as deformity but as a legible subject for observation, emblematic of missionary claims about charity and surgical modernity. The modest gaze invites empathy and records agency within a medical encounter.</p>

        <p>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)<br>
        Lam Qua’s hybrid style merges export-watercolor clarity with European chiaroscuro. Cool blues and neutrals create chromatic restraint; the robe’s folds are modeled with controlled tonal gradations. The composition emphasizes negative space, directing attention to the lobulated mass at the left cheek through contrast of warm flesh against cool garment. Line remains precise around features while edges soften in the garment, balancing contour and volume. The near life-size scale and frontal symmetries produce documentary authority, aligning the image with scientific illustration without surrendering the humane specificity of portraiture.</p>

        <p>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities<br>
        The portrait registers inequalities in access to care and representation. Women in south China faced constraints of domestic labor, footbinding, and limited mobility; large tumors could produce social stigma and economic precarity. Missionary hospitals promised free or subsidized treatment but also operated within colonial trade networks and evangelical aims. The image both dignifies the sitter and participates in a visual economy where Chinese bodies demonstrated Western surgical prowess to foreign patrons. Issues of consent, language mediation, and the politics of looking haunt the series, even as it documents previously invisible patients.</p>

        <p>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology<br>
        The depicted lesion is a large, pedunculated mass over the left mid-face. Differential diagnosis includes a benign parotid neoplasm (especially pleomorphic adenoma), a plexiform neurofibroma, or a vascular malformation (hemangioma/arteriovenous malformation). Pleomorphic adenomas arise from salivary gland epithelial and myoepithelial elements and typically present as a slow-growing, painless mass. Neurofibromas are peripheral nerve sheath tumors associated with NF1 gene variants; plexiform forms can become large and deforming. Vascular malformations reflect congenital errors of vascular development, enlarging over time. Environmental radiation exposure is a known risk for salivary tumors; most cases are otherwise sporadic.</p>

        <p>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness<br>
        Visual cues include smooth, non-ulcerated skin, lobulation, and a broad base—features favoring a benign, long-standing process. The mass sits near the parotid region; absence of depicted trismus or mucosal ulceration and preserved facial expression suggest limited involvement of deep masticator spaces or facial nerve palsy, though these cannot be confirmed from an image. The sitter’s upright posture and composed affect imply chronic adaptation rather than acute pain, consistent with pleomorphic adenoma or neurofibroma rather than aggressive carcinoma.</p>

        <p>[h] Treatment<br>
        In 1836, operative removal would have occurred without modern anesthesia or antisepsis; practitioners used opiates, alcohol, and physical restraint, and controlled hemorrhage with ligatures and cautery. Mortality from sepsis and hemorrhage was significant, and facial nerve injury common. Today, evaluation would include ultrasound and MRI, with fine‑needle aspiration or core biopsy for diagnosis. Management varies by etiology: superficial or total parotidectomy with nerve monitoring for pleomorphic adenoma; staged excision or debulking for plexiform neurofibroma; sclerotherapy/embolization plus surgery for vascular malformations; adjuvant radiotherapy for malignant salivary tumors. Reconstructive options address contour and nerve deficits.</p>

        <p>[i] Social Determinants of Illness<br>
        Tumor size at presentation reflects delayed access tied to poverty, gender norms limiting early clinic visits, transportation barriers, stigma, and fear of disfigurement or surgical risk. In 1830s Guangzhou, care depended on charity hospitals, cross‑cultural trust, and intermediaries. Literacy, language, and household authority could shape consent. Nutrition, infection exposure, and occupational demands influenced recovery. The portrait thus registers how structural conditions—rather than biology alone—govern the trajectory from symptom onset to intervention and social reintegration.</p>
