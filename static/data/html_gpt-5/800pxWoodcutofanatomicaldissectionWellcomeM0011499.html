    <h1>Woodcut of anatomical dissection Wellcome M (800 0011499)</h1>

    <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
    <p>
      This woodcut is by an anonymous printmaker working within the late medieval–early Renaissance European tradition of medical illustration. Its format and iconography align with images produced for early printed medical compendia and university teaching, especially in northern Italy and the German-speaking lands. The scene presents a classic division of labor: a seated lecturer presides from a raised chair while a practical dissector (often a barber-surgeon or prosector) opens the body, surrounded by students and civic witnesses. As a workshop product meant for replication, the block embodies the collaborative networks of printers, physicians, and university authorities.
    </p>

    <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
    <p>
      The image belongs to the period circa 1480–1520, when public anatomies were held at universities such as Bologna, Padua, and Montpellier. These events were scheduled in winter to slow decomposition and were civic spectacles governed by statute and ritual. Contrary to enduring myths, ecclesiastical authorities did not impose a blanket ban on dissection; rather, regulated access and local custom shaped practice. The rise of humanism, with its call to return ad fontes to Galen and Aristotle, combined with print culture to stabilize anatomical images and texts, preparing the ground for sixteenth-century reforms culminating in Vesalius.
    </p>

    <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
    <p>
      The raised chair foregrounds textual authority: the lector reads or indicates a codified body of knowledge. Below, the prosector’s hands-on labor signals the empirical turn yet remains socially subordinate. The gathered men form a semi-circle of learned spectators, transforming the corpse into an object of public pedagogy. The basket of tools and the carefully incised abdomen serve as emblems of artisanal technique. The nude, supine figure echoes classical ideals but also the juridical reality that many cadavers came from executed criminals, whose bodies were thought to serve the common good through postmortem utility.
    </p>

    <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
    <p>
      Executed in a linear woodcut idiom, the image relies on contour, shallow depth, and rhythmic parallel hatching to organize space. Hierarchical composition is central: vertical axes culminate in the enthroned lector, while horizontal vectors—the table and the cadaver—anchor the field. Repetition of rounded caps and cloaks produces visual unity, and the window panels frame the scene like stage wings. The medium’s reproducibility allowed the design to circulate widely, standardizing how a “public anatomy” should look and, by extension, how knowledge should be staged.
    </p>

    <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
    <p>
      Bodies for dissection were obtained through unequal legal regimes that targeted the poor and the criminalized. Women and children were dissected far less often, both for reasons of modesty and because of patterns in execution and mortality. The audience here is exclusively male, reflecting restricted access to higher learning. Thus, the image encodes epistemic privilege: elite scholars interpret working-class hands and marginalized bodies.
    </p>

    <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
    <p>
      The woodcut does not represent a specific disease; the body is anatomic rather than pathologic. Contemporary etiologies followed Galenic humoralism, in which imbalance among blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile—modulated by diet, season, and temperament—explained illness. Miasma (corrupted air) and astral influences were invoked for epidemic diseases. The dissection aims to reveal the macrostructure of organs—liver, stomach, intestines—not lesions; understanding was qualitative and teleological, focused on the “uses of parts” rather than cellular pathology.
    </p>

    <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
    <p>
      The figure is idealized: evenly toned flesh, symmetrical limbs, and absence of sores or trauma. Such stylization suppresses postmortem signs (livor mortis, rigor mortis, bloat) familiar to modern pathology. The only “sign” on display is the incision itself, which marks the body as a didactic field. In the period, visible internal anomalies—enlarged liver, putrefaction, “blackened” organs—might be retrospectively linked to humoral excesses, but the emphasis remained descriptive rather than diagnostic in our modern sense.
    </p>

    <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
    <p>
      Therapies derived from regimen (diet, sleep, exercise), evacuation (phlebotomy, purgatives, emetics), and pharmacopeia (spices, simples, compound theriacs). Surgery was craft-based and pragmatic: wound care, cautery, fracture management, and lithotomy, often performed by barber-surgeons. Antisepsis, anesthesia, and germ theory lay centuries ahead. Nevertheless, anatomies like the one shown refined surgical landmarks and gradually displaced textual authority with observation, paving the way for Vesalian correction of Galenic anatomy.
    </p>

    <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
    <p>
      Urban crowding, poor sanitation, seasonal food insecurity, and war shaped morbidity and mortality. Guild structures and class stratification controlled who received learned care versus artisanal treatment. Legal policies on cadaver supply linked punishment to pedagogy, ensuring that the bodies of the disadvantaged continued to fuel elite knowledge production.
