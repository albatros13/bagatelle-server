        <h1>Dissection of a Cadaver (15th century)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
        This work belongs to the late medieval European tradition of medical illustration, likely produced by an anonymous illuminator working for a university or civic patronage. Such images circulated in medical manuscripts and instructional compendia that synthesized classical (Galenic) knowledge with scholastic commentary. The figures in academic robes and the didactic staging align the piece with the scholarly culture of universities such as Bologna, Paris, or Padua rather than a single named artist.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
        In the 15th century, public or semi-public anatomical demonstrations became periodic events in parts of Europe, especially in Italian and Franco-Flemish centers. Winter months were preferred to slow decay; the body—often that of an executed criminal obtained by civic grant—was opened by a surgeon while a physician or lector read from an authoritative text such as Mondino de Luzzi’s Anathomia (1316). Contrary to persistent myths, ecclesiastical authorities did not universally prohibit dissection; rather, practices were regulated by local custom and law. These sessions consolidated university prestige, affirmed civic order, and negotiated anxieties about death, sanctity, and bodily integrity in a post–Black Death society preoccupied with mortality and medical reform.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
        The central cadaver splayed on a trestle table functions as a memento mori, while the robed observers encode hierarchy: the lecturer gesturing authoritatively, the barber-surgeon handling the knife, and assistants or students in deliberative poses. Architectural backdrops referencing ecclesiastical or civic interiors confer legitimacy. The small dog at the foreground, a frequent medieval motif, can signal fidelity or, more pointedly here, the thin line between human and animal flesh in medical empiricism. Gestural rhetoric—the pointing, counting fingers—visually translates the act of reasoning from observed anatomy to textual knowledge.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
        The illumination’s strong contour lines, saturated pigments, and flattened spatial recession emphasize legibility over naturalistic depth. Repetition of vertical columns frames the composition, while the diagonal of the cadaver’s body organizes sightlines toward the incision. Color coding (academic greens, reds, and blues) distinguishes roles and guides the eye. The rhythmic folds of drapery contrast with the taut, pallid skin of the corpse, a calculated juxtaposition of animate and inanimate textures that heightens didactic clarity.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
        Access to anatomical knowledge was stratified: Latin literacy restricted participation to clerical and university elites; women and most artisans were excluded. Cadaver sources disproportionately drew from the executed poor and marginalized, turning punitive apparatus into scientific resource. Religious minorities and migrants were more vulnerable to body procurement. Thus, anatomical progress was entangled with juridical power and social inequality, a legacy that echoes in later debates over consent and body donation.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
        The image does not document a specific illness but represents late medieval understandings of the body grounded in Galenic-humoral physiology: health as balance of blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile influenced by diet, environment, and temperament. Disease arose from imbalance (dyscrasia) triggered by seasonality, miasma, passions, or corrupted foods. Anatomical opening aimed less at diagnosis of individual pathology than at aligning visible structures with authoritative texts to refine surgical technique and therapeutic regimen.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        The cadaver’s emaciated abdomen, protruding rib cage, and pallor suggest cachexia or postmortem changes rather than a precise disease. The opened lower abdomen indicates a focus on viscera—liver, stomach, intestines—organs central to humoral “concoction” and blood formation in premodern physiology. Absence of thoracic opening reflects contemporary ritual order of dissection (abdomen first, thorax second, head last), not diagnostic priority.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
        Therapeutics of the period emphasized restoration of balance through regimen (diet, sleep, exercise), phlebotomy and purgation, and materia medica from simples and compound drugs. Surgical knowledge benefited from anatomical demonstrations, improving procedures for hernia repair, wound management, and lithotomy. Preservation techniques for the dissection—cold weather, fragrant herbs, wine or vinegar rinses—anticipate later antiseptic concerns even as microbial theory remained centuries away.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
        Urban crowding, poor sanitation, intermittent famine, and labor hazards shaped morbidity and mortality. Class determined exposure to contagion and access to care: elites could secure physicians and controlled diets; the poor relied on lay healers, hospitals, and confraternities. Gender norms limited women’s formal training yet made them essential caregivers; their experiential knowledge rarely entered the Latin record. Political stability, trade networks, and climate variability (the Little Ice Age) modulated epidemic risk and therapeutic resources.
