        <h2>Art-historical and Biomedical Analysis</h2>

        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</strong><br>
        This figure belongs to the tradition of Chinese medical artisans who produced anatomical teaching models for physicians and apprentices of classical medicine. Such models were typically crafted by anonymous workshop specialists working for medical academies, temple pharmacies, or physician lineages. Their makers combined sculptural skill with technical knowledge of channel topography, inscribing acupoint names and numbers to fix an authoritative map for clinical training.</p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</strong><br>
        Acupuncture models have a long lineage beginning with the famous bronze figures commissioned by the imperial physician Wang Weiyi in 1027 CE under the Song dynasty. Later eras, especially the Ming and Qing periods (14th–19th centuries), saw widespread use of wooden, lacquer, or plaster figures in private clinics and schools. They reflect a scholarly-medical culture in which mastery of the “classic” literature—particularly the Huangdi Neijing—was paired with practical training. In the early modern period, such models circulated beyond East Asia through Jesuit and maritime networks, shaping European curiosity about Chinese anatomy and therapeutics.</p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</strong><br>
        The surface is densely pricked with dots and short inscriptions that name loci such as hegu (LI4) or zusanli (ST36). These marks visualize the otherwise invisible meridians (jingluo), the conduits of qi and blood. The unadorned, standing nude provides a neutral, idealized body that transcends individual identity, becoming a mnemonic device for medical geography. The topknot evokes a conventionalized scholar-patient, while the pedestal suggests the figure’s status as a didactic effigy rather than a devotional idol.</p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</strong><br>
        The proportions are compact and volumetric, with a gentle contrapposto that keeps the mass stable. The rhythmic distribution of dots creates visual cadence along limbs and torso, guiding the viewer’s eye in the same sequences a practitioner follows when palpating a channel. Repetition, alignment, and balance are functional design principles: the points are spaced to teach relative distance—cun measurements—instead of absolute centimeters. The aged surface and patination index prolonged handling, signaling the object’s life as a studio instrument.</p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</strong><br>
        Historically, access to learned medicine in China was stratified. Urban elites studied texts and could acquire instruments like this model, whereas rural healers relied on oral transmission and limited equipment. Gender norms influenced training tools: male figures predominated, while female models were rarer and often modified to accommodate modesty codes, shaping what conditions could be taught and treated. State examinations and guild structures further concentrated authority among literati physicians, marginalizing midwives and itinerant practitioners.</p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</strong><br>
        In the classical framework, illness arises from disharmonies of qi, blood, and fluids within the zang-fu organs and along the channels, perturbed by internal emotions or external climatic “evils” (wind, cold, damp, heat). The model supports instruction for common patterns such as bi syndrome (painful obstruction), headaches, digestive irregularities, gynecologic disorders, and paralysis after stroke. From a biomedical perspective, contemporary research evaluates acupuncture’s effects on nociception, autonomic modulation, and neuroimmune signaling, particularly for chronic musculoskeletal pain and chemotherapy-induced nausea.</p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</strong><br>
        Diagnostically, practitioners read signs through pulse qualities, tongue appearance, and palpation of tender nodules or taut bands that align with the inscribed channels. The model’s point clusters at joints and muscle partitions highlight proprioceptive gateways where needling can evoke deqi—a deep, aching sensation—associated with therapeutic response. Iconographically, the density of points along the back shu and abdomen mu zones encodes a logic: dorsal points access organ-related regulatory nodes; ventral points mirror viscera.</p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment</strong><br>
        The figure teaches safe angles, depths, and point groupings for acupuncture and moxibustion. Typical prescriptions may pair distal with local points (e.g., LI4 with ST36 for analgesia), employ tonification versus dispersion techniques, or add heat stimulus via moxa at cold-damp patterns. Modern clinical guidelines emphasize sterile single-use needles, anatomical caution at thorax and neck, and individualized dosing across multiple sessions. Evidence is strongest for chronic primary pain conditions; adjunctive benefits exist for postoperative nausea and migraine prophylaxis. Integration with manual therapy, cupping, and herbal formulas is common, though protocols vary by lineage and regulatory setting.</p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</strong><br>
        The mapping of channels encodes historical awareness of environment: wind exposure, labor posture, diet, and seasonal change were treated as causal contexts, not mere background. Today, inequities persist in insurance coverage, practitioner distribution, and cultural-linguistic access, shaping who receives acupuncture. Migrant communities may rely on affordable clinic models, while rural areas face provider scarcity. Regulation and quality control influence safety and outcomes, demonstrating how policy, education, and economics intersect with embodied care.</p>
