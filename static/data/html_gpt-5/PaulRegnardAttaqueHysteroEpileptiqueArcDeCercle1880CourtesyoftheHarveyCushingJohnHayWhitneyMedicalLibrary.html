<h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
<p>Paul Regnard (1850–1927) was a French physiologist and medical photographer associated with the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris. Working alongside Jean-Martin Charcot, Désiré-Magloire Bourneville, and Paul Richer, Regnard helped pioneer the systematic use of photography in clinical documentation. His plates, often produced for the multivolume Iconographie photographique de la Salpêtrière, combine scientific ambition with an emergent visual rhetoric of pathology. In this image, his role blends technician, witness, and image-maker, translating a fleeting bodily event into a durable visual “proof” designed to convince both physicians and the broader public.</p>

<h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
<p>The photograph dates to the late 1870s–1880s, a period when neurology and psychiatry were consolidating as specialties in France. Charcot’s public lessons at the Salpêtrière turned the hospital into a theatrical space for demonstrating hysteria and epilepsy. Photography, then viewed as a truth-bearing medium, functioned as evidence in the positivist culture of the Third Republic. At the same time, Parisian visual culture—art academies, illustrated journals, and medical atlases—circulated such images widely. The resulting traffic between clinic and culture blurred boundaries between scientific record and staged spectacle, shaping how illness was seen and understood.</p>

<h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
<p>The “arc de cercle” shows a body in extreme hyperextension, historically read as a signature phase within Charcot’s “grand hysterical attack.” The bed rail, plain linens, and centered framing code the scene as clinical. The printed plate caption beneath the image functions like an icon label, fixing interpretation before the viewer looks. The pose echoes older iconographies of possession and exorcism, which Charcot and his circle explicitly reinterpreted as medical phenomena. Thus the image operates symbolically on two registers: as a scientific sign of a diagnostic category and as a re-enactment of long-standing cultural imagery of the convulsed or afflicted body.</p>

<h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
<p>Regnard employs frontal, even lighting and a shallow stage-like space that eliminates distraction and emphasizes contour. The long horizontal of the mattress contrasts with the taut parabola of the spine, producing a clear figure–ground separation and a strong rhythm from feet to head. The mid-distance viewpoint keeps the whole body legible, while the sparse tonality and lack of props enforce a documentary aesthetic. Typography—“Planche III,” the French title—integrates text and photograph, aligning the image with the authority of the scientific plate. Stylistically, the neutrality is calculated: it constructs an ideal type, a visually persuasive “normal form” of an abnormal sign.</p>

<h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
<p>Most Salpêtrière patients were poor women whose images circulated without the control afforded to bourgeois sitters. Power asymmetries—physician over patient, photographer over subject—informed both production and reception. The diagnostic category of “hystero-epilepsy” mapped cultural anxieties about femininity and moral comportment onto female bodies, sometimes obscuring trauma, poverty, or abuse. Reproduction of these plates in albums, lectures, and postcards commodified the patients’ suffering and helped naturalize gendered ideas about mental illness. Contemporary critique rightly asks how consent, privacy, and the staging of symptoms shaped what the camera recorded and what viewers came to believe.</p>

<h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
<p>“Hystero-epilepsy” was Charcot’s hybrid term for attacks combining elements of epilepsy with what he defined as hysteria. Modern medicine recognizes several distinct entities: epileptic seizures due to abnormal cortical discharges and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), typically conceptualized within functional neurological disorder (FND). PNES arise from complex interactions among stress, trauma, dissociation, and neurocognitive network dysregulation rather than synchronous neuronal firing. The nineteenth-century uterine etiology of “hysteria” is obsolete. While the photograph cannot determine diagnosis, it documents a posture historically associated with the tonic arching called opisthotonus, which can occur in epileptic seizures, FND episodes, and in rare toxic or infectious states.</p>

<h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
<p>The arching “arc de cercle” corresponds to axial hyperextension with rigid paraspinal contraction. In epileptic generalized tonic-clonic seizures, such posturing may accompany the tonic phase, often with impaired awareness, cyanosis, and postictal confusion. In PNES, episodes may feature prolonged, fluctuating movements, eye closure, and preserved responsiveness between waves of activity. Historically, clinicians also considered differential diagnoses such as tetanus, strychnine poisoning, or meningeal irritation, where persistent opisthotonus reflects severe neuromuscular excitation. As a still image, the plate indexes a sign rather than a syndrome; modern diagnosis requires history, examination, and, when indicated, EEG or video-EEG monitoring.</p>

<h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
<p>In Charcot’s era, interventions included hypnosis, rest cures, isolation, and electrical stimulation (faradization), reflecting both therapeutic optimism and coercive control. Present-day care is stratified. For epilepsy, antiseizure medications and, in selected cases, surgery or neuromodulation are evidence-based. For PNES/FND, best practice emphasizes compassionate disclosure of the diagnosis, psychoeducation, cognitive-behavioral and trauma-focused therapies, and treatment of comorbid anxiety, depression, or PTSD; antiseizure drugs are ineffective for PNES. Across conditions, safety, avoidance of iatrogenic harm, and interdisciplinary follow-up are essential.</p>

<h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
<p>Poverty, gendered violence, limited access to mental health care, and institutionalization shaped who appeared at the Salpêtrière and how their symptoms were interpreted. Today, diagnostic delay, limited specialty services, cultural stigma around seizures, and insurance barriers continue to influence outcomes for both epilepsy and FND. Education, employment security, and social support are protective factors; conversely, unstable housing, trauma exposure, and discrimination heighten vulnerability and complicate adherence to treatment plans.</p>
