        <h1>Muscle man Vesalius University of Oklahoma History of Science (Collection)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The plate is associated with Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564), the pioneering anatomist whose De humani corporis fabrica (1543) transformed European medical knowledge. While Vesalius authored and supervised the anatomy, the images are commonly attributed to Jan Steven van Calcar, a pupil of Titian, working with Basel printer Johannes Oporinus. The collaborative authorship—physician, draftsman, block-cutter, and printer—embodies Renaissance workshop practice where artistic virtuosity served scientific truth.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in mid-sixteenth-century Renaissance Europe, the “muscle man” belongs to a moment when humanist scholarship, print culture, and university-based dissection converged. Padua’s medical school sanctioned public dissections, while the printing press enabled rapid dissemination of standardized images. The plate’s classical stance and Italianate landscape align anatomy with antiquity’s authority, even as Vesalius challenged Galenic orthodoxy by privileging observation over textual tradition.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The flayed standing figure—an écorché—displays layered musculature as if peeling a didactic curtain. The contrapposto echoes Greco-Roman statuary, visually asserting that empirical knowledge can be beautiful and ordered. The landscape backdrop situates the body in the living world, suggesting that anatomy is not a clandestine act but a civic, even humanist, pursuit. The draped skin in the hand functions as memento mori and as a metaphor for unveiling nature’s secrets.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Woodcut hatching renders volume through dense cross-lines, modeling the rectus femoris, sartorius, and gastrocnemius with sculptural clarity. Rhythmic repetition of striations establishes movement across muscle groups, while hierarchical emphasis directs the eye from neck and shoulder girdle to the powerful legs. Proportions are idealized, yet insertions and origins are carefully placed, making the plate both aesthetic object and functional map. Spatial recession of the landscape deepens the figure’s plasticity, reinforcing visual legibility of anatomical planes.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Early modern dissections often used bodies of executed criminals, the poor, or the socially marginalized, reflecting unequal power over remains. Access to the knowledge encoded in such prints was mediated by Latin literacy and the cost of large-format books, privileging elite physicians and universities. Gendered exclusions shaped both subject and audience; female anatomy was underrepresented, and women were largely barred from institutional learning.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Although the plate does not depict a specific pathology, its granular depiction of fascicles, compartments, and tendinous insertions underpins the understanding of muscular disease. Relevant etiologic categories include trauma (leading to acute compartment syndrome), ischemic and exertional injury (rhabdomyolysis), infectious processes (necrotizing fasciitis), immune-mediated myopathies (polymyositis, dermatomyositis), and genetic myopathies (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy caused by dystrophin mutations). Metabolic derangements, toxins, and iatrogenic causes (e.g., statin-associated myopathy) further illustrate how systemic factors manifest in muscle tissues that Vesalius mapped.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The plate highlights discrete myofascial compartments of the limbs—critical for recognizing compartment syndrome where rising intracompartmental pressure compromises perfusion. Clinically, pain out of proportion, pain with passive stretch, paresthesia, pallor, and pulselessness may appear. The extensive depiction of proximal girdle muscles aids pattern recognition in inflammatory myopathies, which present with symmetric proximal weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase. For rhabdomyolysis, diffuse myalgia, weakness, and dark urine signal myocyte breakdown with myoglobinuria. The delineated aponeuroses and fascial septa also guide understanding of infection spread in necrotizing fasciitis, where rapid tissue destruction, crepitus, and systemic toxicity demand urgent action.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Acute compartment syndrome requires prompt fasciotomy; delay risks irreversible necrosis. Rhabdomyolysis management centers on aggressive intravenous fluids, electrolyte correction, and addressing precipitating causes. Immune-mediated myopathies are treated with corticosteroids and steroid-sparing immunosuppressants; targeted biologics may be considered in refractory disease. Duchenne muscular dystrophy care combines corticosteroids, cardiopulmonary support, physical therapy, and, for eligible genotypes, exon-skipping or gene-targeted therapies. Necrotizing fasciitis mandates early broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement, often repeated. Across conditions, rehabilitation anchored in precise anatomy (range-of-motion, strengthening balanced against overuse) remains essential.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Injury risk is shaped by labor conditions, military service, and access to protective equipment. Timely diagnosis depends on proximity to emergency care and diagnostic tools (labs for CK, MRI), which are unevenly distributed. Nutrition, housing stability, and environmental heat exposure influence rhabdomyolysis risk during exertion. Insurance coverage and availability of specialty centers affect access to genetic testing, advanced therapeutics, and long-term rehabilitation for myopathies. Historical inequities in whose bodies were dissected parallel contemporary disparities in who bears disease burden and who benefits from research advances.</p>
