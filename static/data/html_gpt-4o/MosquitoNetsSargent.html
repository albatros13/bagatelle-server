        <h1>Mosquito Nets Sargent: An Art Historical and Biomedical Perspective</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>John Singer Sargent, an American expatriate artist, is renowned for his masterful portraits and scenes that capture the vibrancy of his subjects. Known for his contributions to the late 19th and early 20th-century art world, Sargent's work often explored human emotions and societal themes through an impressionistic lens.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in the early 1900s, "Mosquito Nets" reflects a time when travel and tropical diseases were increasingly significant topics due to colonial expansion and global trade. The socio-cultural context of this period was marked by technological advancements and a heightened awareness of diseases such as malaria.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The mosquito nets in the painting are not just practical items; they symbolize protection against the unseen threats of infectious diseases. This artwork captures the tension between vulnerability and the human desire for safety and exploration.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Sargent's use of loose brushwork and rich colors conveys a sense of immediacy and liveliness. The composition, balanced with a harmonious color palette, emphasizes the delicate details of the mosquito nets, creating a contrast between the light and the enveloping shadows.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting subtly highlights social inequities, as mosquito nets were a luxury not accessible to all, especially in colonial regions. The imagery provokes thoughts on how socioeconomic status affected disease prevention and health outcomes.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Malaria, a disease transmitted by mosquito bites, is the biomedical focal point of this artwork. Caused by Plasmodium parasites, it leads to symptoms such as fever, chills, and anemia. During Sargent's time, malaria was pervasive in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In "Mosquito Nets," the somnolent posture of the figures can imply fatigue, a symptom associated with malaria. The nets serve as a preventative measure, highlighting the preventative efforts against a known and ever-present threat.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, quinine was the primary treatment for malaria. The use of mosquito nets, as depicted, becomes a visual metaphor for preventative healthcare actions taken to mitigate the spread and impact of malaria.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The artwork hints at broader social determinants of health, such as access to medical knowledge and preventive resources like nets. These determinants were often influenced by race, class, and colonial power dynamics.</p>
