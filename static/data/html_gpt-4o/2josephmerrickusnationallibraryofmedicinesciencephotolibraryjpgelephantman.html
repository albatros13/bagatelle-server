        <h1>Art and Science of Joseph Merrick</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork depicting Joseph Merrick, commonly known as the "Elephant Man," is an illustration frequently associated with medical and historical archives rather than a specific artist. Such images typically come from anatomical illustrations or medical documentations of the late 19th century. The depiction aims to catalog the unique physiological anomalies presented by Merrick.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This illustration originates from the Victorian era, primarily the late 1800s. A period marked by significant medical advancements yet also rampant with misunderstandings around physical deformities, it was a time of both enlightenment and discrimination. Joseph Merrick became a public figure in London, appearing in human oddity exhibitions, which were a popular form of entertainment during this era.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>While the primary purpose of the illustration was to serve medical science, the image has deep symbolism and iconographic elements related to themes of humanity, innocence, and suffering. Merrick's figure often evokes empathy and reflects societal attitudes toward those who are different. The image has transcended its initial clinical intention, becoming a symbol for the struggle for dignity and acceptance.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The illustrative style is meticulous and clinical, characteristic of Victorian medical drawings. The emphasis on anatomical detail serves both a scientific function and a stylistic choice. The use of chiaroscuro—contrast between light and shadow—highlights the contours and textures of Merrick's skin and deformities, drawing attention to the figure's physicality and intricacy.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Merrick's life is a poignant depiction of social and cultural inequities. His condition made him subject to exploitation and marginalization, both in life and posthumously. The Victorian era's fascination with "freak shows" underscores a darker aspect of cultural voyeurism and the dehumanization of those deemed ‘other.’ Societal structure at the time provided little accommodation or respect for Merrick’s condition, leading to a challenging life.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Joseph Merrick is believed to have suffered from Proteus syndrome, a rare disorder that causes overgrowth of skin, bones, muscles, fatty tissues, and blood vessels. The etiology involves a mutation in the AKT1 gene, which occurs during embryonic development. Symptoms include asymmetric overgrowth and distinctive facial features, evident in the illustration.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The illustration showcases several hallmark signs of Merrick's condition. Notable are the thickened skin and prominent overgrowths on his limbs and head. The disproportionate growth caused considerable disfigurement and is visually distinct. Such depictions helped document his condition, contributing valuable insight for later medical studies.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Merrick’s lifetime, treatment options for conditions like Proteus syndrome were virtually non-existent. Medical care focused primarily on symptom management rather than cure. Merrick received shelter and care at the London Hospital, where his well-being was significantly improved through compassionate management rather than medical intervention.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social determinants significantly impacted Merrick's quality of life. Class, societal attitudes towards disability, access to medical care, and economic status played crucial roles. These factors often dictated the level of support, or lack thereof, he received. His association with the hospital later in life improved living conditions, providing some relief from societal neglect.</p>
