        <h1>Art and Medicine: An Analysis of "Goiter"</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork depicting a goiter is believed to have been created by an unknown medieval artist. This work is part of illuminated manuscripts that were commonly produced by monks in European monasteries during the Middle Ages. These artisans were skilled in creating detailed illustrations that accompanied texts, often created with the dual purpose of educating and offering spiritual reflection.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This artwork likely originates from the 12th to 14th century Europe, a period characterized by significant religious, social, and scientific developments. During this time, art served as a pivotal medium for documenting and conveying knowledge, including medical conditions like goiter. The socio-cultural context provided a setting where medical knowledge was largely based on observation and anecdote rather than systematic scientific inquiry.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The illustration of goiter in medieval art often symbolized not just the physical ailment but a moral or spiritual deficiency. In a time where physical deformities or conditions were commonly associated with spiritual failing, the depiction might have served as a cautionary tale. The decorative frame and inclusion of mythical creatures can signify protection and warning, typical iconographic elements used in such manuscripts.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork reflects the stylistic approach of medieval manuscript illumination, characterized by the use of vivid colors, decorative borders, and intricate detailing. The central figure is often highly stylized rather than realistic, reflecting the period's convention of symbolic rather than naturalistic representation. Emphasis is placed on outline and flat areas of color, focusing on conveying the narrative rather than optical realism.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This period's art reflects social inequities inherent in medieval Europe. Access to medical knowledge and treatment was largely restricted to the affluent, often depicted in the attire and backgrounds of the illustrations. The depiction of diseases in art typically served the literate elite, preserving socio-economic hierarchies through controlled knowledge dissemination.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Goiter refers to the abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland, often visible as a significant bulge in the neck. During the medieval period, knowledge about its etiology was limited. Today, goiters are understood to be caused primarily by iodine deficiency, autoimmune diseases, or thyroiditis, although these were not recognized at the time.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The main sign of goiter is the noticeable swelling in the neck region. This depiction in the artwork faithfully represents the condition’s most visually apparent symptom, drawing attention to both its physical and potential metaphysical implications during the time.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the Middle Ages, treatments for goiter were rudimentary and often ineffective. Herbal remedies, dietary changes, and rudimentary surgeries were common. Today, treatment involves iodine supplementation for deficiency, surgical removal, or hormone therapy, none of which were available or understood in medieval times.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Medieval Europeans often lived in regions iodine-deficient, especially those far from the sea. The consumption of grains grown in iodine-poor soil exacerbated this condition, linking socio-economic status and geographic location to health outcomes. The lack of iodine-rich diets and limited access to medical interventions reflected larger societal inequities that defined health disparities.</p>
