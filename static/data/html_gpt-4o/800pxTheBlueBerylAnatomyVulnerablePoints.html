        <h1>The Blue Beryl Anatomy Vulnerable Points (800)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        The artwork known as "The Blue Beryl Anatomy Vulnerable Points" originates from the Tibetan medical tradition, often attributed to Yutog Yontan Gonpo, a prominent figure in Tibetan medicine. This tradition is known for its intricate blend of art and medical knowledge, aiming to convey complex biomedical information visually.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        Created around the 17th century, these paintings are part of "The Blue Beryl" or "Baidurya Ngonpo," a crucial text for Tibetan medicine compiled by Desi Sangye Gyatso, regent of the 5th Dalai Lama. The artwork reflects a period of vibrant scholarly and cultural interchange in Tibet, with significant influence from Indian, Chinese, and Greco-Arab medical traditions.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        The paintings are rich in symbolism, depicting the human body, its organs, and energy channels, known as 'tsas.' The grid and iconography are designed to illustrate the coursing of wind, bile, and phlegm—the three humors believed to govern bodily function and disease in Tibetan medicine. Each symbol and icon serves as a visual metaphor for understanding anatomy and pathology.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        The stylistic elements include a precise use of line, color, and form, emphasizing clarity and the conveyance of complex information in digestible visual formats. The symmetry and balance within the imagery serve not only aesthetic purposes but also practical ones by aiding in the comprehension of medical concepts. 

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        Despite its historical and cultural richness, Tibetan medicine, including the art form of the Blue Beryl, often faces challenges like marginalization and underrepresentation in the global medical landscape. Political and cultural suppression, and the encroachment of modern medical practices, pose significant threats to the transmission of this traditional knowledge.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        Within these illustrations, diseases are depicted as imbalances of the three humors. Causes are often attributed to lifestyle, diet, and environmental factors impacting the flow of energy channels and organ function. The art aids in diagnosing these imbalances through visual indicators and annotations.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        Pathology is visually represented through symbolic depictions of blocked or distorted channels and the misalignment of humors. Specific areas and points on the body are highlighted to signify vulnerability to disease, aligning with Tibetan diagnostic techniques involving pulse reading and observation.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        Treatments typically involve restoring the balance of the three humors, using methods like herbal medicine, dietary advice, physical exercises, and spiritual practices. The artwork itself is a teaching tool for healers, illustrating the pathways through which interventions can be effectively applied.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Tibetan medical traditions recognize social and environmental factors as crucial determinants of health. Issues like access to clean water, balanced nutrition, and socioeconomic status are reflected in the etiology and treatment of illnesses, emphasizing holistic well-being intertwined with societal context.
