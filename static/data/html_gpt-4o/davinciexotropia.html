        <h1>Salvator Mundi and Exotropia</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        Leonardo da Vinci, the renowned Italian polymath of the Renaissance, painted "Salvator Mundi" around 1500. As a scientist, mathematician, and innovator, da Vinci made groundbreaking contributions to various fields, and his art continues to captivate audiences with its depth and complexity.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        The Renaissance marked a period of renewed interest in the natural world, humanity, and classical learning. Da Vinci's "Salvator Mundi," situated within this context, reflects a blend of scientific inquiry and spiritual reverence. Painted in a time of intense religious significance, it underscores the fusion of observational precision with religious iconography.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        "Salvator Mundi," meaning "Savior of the World," depicts Christ with a raised right hand in benediction and an orb in his left. This orb symbolizes the celestial sphere, representing Christ's dominion over the world. The painting's iconography reflects both divine and earthly realms, emphasizing unity between the two.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        Da Vinci's technique in "Salvator Mundi" demonstrates his mastery of sfumato, a painting technique that creates a soft transition between colors and tones. The painting is characterized by its delicate gradations and meticulous attention to anatomical details, evoking a sense of depth and realism.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        During the Renaissance, access to artistic training and patronage was largely limited to the elite. Da Vinci's works, often commissioned by powerful patrons, reflect the societal hierarchies of the time. Art could serve as both a means of personal expression and a demonstration of wealth and power.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        The condition of exotropia, a form of strabismus characterized by an outward deviation of the eyes, has been suggested in analyses of the painting. It is a binocular vision disorder that affects the alignment of the eyes, possibly influencing the depiction of Christ in "Salvator Mundi."

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        In "Salvator Mundi," the positioning of the eyes may hint at exotropia. Subtle misalignments suggest a divergence that could be interpreted as a symptom of the condition. The asymmetry of the eyes contributes to the enigmatic expression often noted in da Vinci's portrayal of figures.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        During the Renaissance, understanding and treatment of eye conditions like exotropia were limited. Today, treatments can include corrective lenses, vision therapy, and in some cases, surgery. Early detection and intervention remain crucial for effective management of such conditions.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Factors such as access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, and education can impact the diagnosis and treatment of conditions like exotropia. In the Renaissance, medical knowledge was largely inaccessible to common people, underscoring the disparities in healthcare.
