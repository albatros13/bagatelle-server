        <h1>Salvador Dalí - Hysteria Snail</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork, titled "Hysteria Snail," was created by Salvador Dalí, a prominent figure in the Surrealist movement. Dalí was known for his eccentric works that often combined dreamlike imagery with finely detailed realism. His approach sought to challenge perception, questioning reality by juxtaposing unexpected and often bizarre elements.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This piece likely emerged during the height of the Surrealist movement in the early to mid-20th century. This was a period characterized by radical changes in art, literature, and society, with many artists seeking to explore the unconscious mind. Dalí’s work reflected the instability and surreal nature of the era, drawing from personal experiences and societal shifts through two World Wars and the Great Depression.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>Symbolism in Dalí's work is rich and varied. The snail is a recurring motif and has often been interpreted as representing slow movement or the unconscious. Coupled with the distorted human forms, the piece suggests a tension between the conscious self and the subconscious. The soft, melting forms and juxtaposition of smooth versus rough textures can be seen as a metaphor for mental turmoil.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Dalí's use of line is delicate yet precise, allowing for a sense of movement and flow. His muted color palette emphasizes contrast and draws attention to form and figure. The principles of balance and contrast are evident, particularly in the way that various elements interact within the frame, creating a cohesive yet unsettling visual experience.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During Dalí’s time, societal structures were dramatically changing, influenced by the political upheaval across Europe and emerging social inequalities. His works often portrayed these tensions, deliberately provoking thoughts about the divisions in society and the psychological impacts thereof. "Hysteria Snail" might correspond to the idea of the individual struggling against societal norms and pressures.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The artwork's title suggests a reflection on "hysteria," a term historically used to describe a variety of mental disorders primarily in women. While outdated and rooted in gender-biased medical practices, the term evokes a complex history of misunderstood psychological conditions, tracing roots back to Hippocrates and evolving through Freudian theories.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The twisting forms and the metamorphosis of human elements in the piece may represent the distortion and struggle associated with mental illness. The snail, dragging slowly, might indicate the burden and lethargy linked with psychological disorders, suggesting an inner battle that appears externalized within the piece.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the time this artwork might represent, treatment for hysteria and associated medical issues varied widely. Historical treatments were often invasive and non-efficacious, including leeches and hysterectomies. However, approaches evolved to include psychoanalysis, which Dalí had a particular interest in, as evidenced by his fascination with Freud’s theories.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social determinants such as gender, societal roles, and the stigma surrounding mental illness are likely underlying themes in this work. The historical confinement of women to specific societal roles may reflect the pressures and mental strain that manifest as the "hysterical" conditions depicted by Dalí.</p>
