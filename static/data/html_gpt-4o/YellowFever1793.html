        <h1>Yellow Fever (1793)</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork capturing the ravages of the Yellow Fever epidemic of 1793 is an exceptional piece, extensively used in medical journals of the period. Although the exact artist remains anonymous, it reflects the style of medical illustration common in the late 18th century focused on educational purposes for both the medical community and the general public.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>During the late 18th century, Philadelphia was a bustling city and the temporary capital of the United States. The Yellow Fever epidemic of 1793 was a pivotal event, resulting in widespread panic and social disruption. The artwork was created in this context, offering insight into the medical understanding and social impacts of the disease at the time.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The series of images in the artwork depict the stages of Yellow Fever, symbolizing the progression of the illness from healthy to gravely ill. The patient's changing visage in each panel serves as a stark representation of the disease's severity and rapid development. Blood and jaundice, evident in the illustrations, further symbolize the physiological impact of the fever.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>This artwork employs a realistic style, with a focus on detail and coloring to emphasize medical features. Line and form are used to show the stark contrast between wellness and illness. The sequential arrangement enhances understanding of the disease's progression, a principle reflecting early medical didactic art.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The epidemic disproportionately affected lower socioeconomic groups, including African American laborers and immigrants, who lacked the means to flee or access advanced care. This artwork, while clinical, also underscores the disparities in health outcomes of the time due to social standing.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Yellow Fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by mosquitoes. The 1793 epidemic in Philadelphia was exacerbated by poor sanitation and a lack of understanding of transmission methods. The artwork helps document the clinical signs associated with the disease during this era.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the illustrations, signs of Yellow Fever include jaundice, depicted through the yellowing of the skin, and bleeding, noted in the later stages as shown by the presence of blood. The artistic portrayal provided a visual confirmation of the disease's physical signs at a time when diagnosis was primarily observational.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment during the 1793 epidemic was largely symptomatic and included practices such as bloodletting, which were common yet largely ineffective. The artwork subtly critiques these methods by illustrating the often-uncontrolled progression of the disease despite medical intervention.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors like poverty, poor urban planning, and lack of access to healthcare played critical roles in the spread and severity of the outbreak. The depicted scenes echo the vulnerability of urban populations to such diseases, exacerbated by crowded and unsanitary living conditions.</p>
