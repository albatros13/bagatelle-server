        <h2>The Frailty of Human Life by Salvator Rosa (1656)</h2>
        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe:</strong> The artwork, "The Frailty of Human Life," was crafted by the Italian artist Salvator Rosa in 1656. Rosa was a Baroque painter and a member of the Neapolitan School. Known for his romantic and innovative landscape paintings, Rosa also delved into themes of existentialism, portraying the tumultuous and unpredictable nature of human existence.</p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context:</strong> Created in the mid-17th century, this artwork emerged during a time plagued by recurrent outbreaks of the plague. The year 1656, explicitly, marked a devastating plague in Naples, which significantly influenced cultural expressions. The painting reflects the collective trauma and existential angst of the populace, where death was an omnipresent reality.</p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography:</strong> In "The Frailty of Human Life," the looming figure of a skeletal Death signifies the inevitability of mortality and the transient nature of life. The presence of a mother and child alludes to the cycle of life and innocence threatened by death. Such imagery gives the painting a deeply metaphysical appeal, prompting reflections on the uncertainties of life.</p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance:</strong> The painting exemplifies the Baroque penchant for dramatic contrast and emotional intensity. Rosa's use of chiaroscuro — the stark interplay of light and shadow — enhances the painting's emotional impact, while his dynamic composition and rich textures add layers of complexity that are emblematic of Baroque art.</p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities:</strong> The time was marked by stark social disparities exacerbated by disease. The urban poor bore the brunt of the pestilence due to overcrowded living conditions and inadequate health facilities. Rosa’s work subtly critiques these inequities by juxtaposing the vulnerable against the inescapable grimness of death.</p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology:</strong> The plague was a bacterial infection caused by <em>Yersinia pestis</em>, typically transmitted through flea bites and person-to-person contact. Symptoms included fever, vomiting, muscle pain, and buboes. This highly contagious disease spread rapidly, claiming millions of lives across Europe.</p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness:</strong> Rosa’s depiction of pallor and skeletal devastation hints at the bodily deterioration associated with the plague. The visible suffering underscores the physical manifestations of the disease — such as emaciation and fever — captured poignantly in the expressions and postures of the figures.</p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment:</strong> During the 17th century, treatments were rudimentary and largely ineffective. They included primitive quarantine measures, bloodletting, and the use of various herbs and concoctions. The lack of a comprehensive understanding of disease transmission severely limited the effectiveness of these interventions.</p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness:</strong> Overcrowding, poverty, and poor sanitation were significant factors that facilitated the spread of the plague. These conditions were pervasive in European cities, particularly in lower socioeconomic sectors, highlighting the disparities in health outcomes based on social determinants.</p>
