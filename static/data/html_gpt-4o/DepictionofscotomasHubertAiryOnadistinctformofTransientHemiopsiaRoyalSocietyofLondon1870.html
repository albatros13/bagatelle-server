        <h2>Depiction of Scotomas by Hubert Airy (1870)</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Hubert Airy was a 19th-century British physician and researcher known for his work on visual disturbances related to migraines. His interest in neurology and ophthalmology led him to study various forms of visual phenomena, such as scotomas, which are areas of partial alteration in the field of vision.</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>The artwork "Depiction of Scotomas" was created in 1870, during a period when the scientific community was beginning to systematically explore the connections between neurology and visual disturbances. The late 19th century was a time of significant advancements in medical science, such as the conceptual development of neural pathways and the beginning of modern neuroscience.</p>
        
        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>This work visually represents scotomas, highlighting their complex shapes and patterns. The imagery is not only a scientific illustration but also serves as a metaphor for the elusive and sometimes distressing nature of migraines. The swirling, almost hypnotic patterns symbolize the chaos and disruption these visual disturbances cause.</p>
        
        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>Airy's depiction utilizes strong contrasts and intricate designs, creating an almost mesmerizing pattern that reflects the principles of unity and rhythm within the elements of art. The use of line and shape is prominent, capturing the swirling nature of scotomas with a precision that is both artistic and scientific.</p>
        
        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Access to scientific knowledge in the 19th century was predominantly restricted to a privileged few, often white male scientists. The exploration of diseases like migraines may have been limited in scope due to the lack of diverse perspectives in the medical community.</p>
        
        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Migraine is a neurological disease characterized by recurrent headaches and associated symptoms, including visual disturbances like scotomas. The etiology of migraines is complex, involving genetic, environmental, and neurological factors that influence nerve signaling and vascular changes in the brain.</p>
        
        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Scotomas, as depicted by Airy, are a classic sign of migraine with aura. These are temporary visual disturbances that can manifest as blind spots, flashes, or zigzag patterns, which were meticulously documented in Airy's illustration.</p>
        
        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Migraine management in the 19th century was rudimentary compared to today, often involving rest and simple analgesics. Modern treatment includes a combination of pharmacological interventions like triptans, preventive medications, and lifestyle modifications to reduce trigger exposure.</p>
        
        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Migraine prevalence and management can be significantly affected by social determinants such as access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, and education. These factors can influence the likelihood of receiving a proper diagnosis and effective treatment.</p>
