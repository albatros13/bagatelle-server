        <h1>Vision of the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork "Vision of the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel" is a renowned painting by Paul Gauguin, a leading post-impressionist artist known for his experimental use of color and synthesis of symbolic content. Gauguin's work has been pivotal in moving away from the representational art of Impressionism, focusing instead on exploring the deeper meanings behind subject matter and form.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted in 1888, this artwork belongs to a period when Gauguin was living in Pont-Aven, a commune in Brittany, France. This was a fertile period in Gauguin’s life where he sought to distance himself from Western society's constraints, immersing himself in a simpler, more spiritual world. The socio-cultural environment of Brittany, with its rich tradition and distinctive costumes, profoundly influenced Gauguin and is reflected in this painting.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting depicts a biblical scene from the Old Testament where Jacob wrestles with an angel. However, Gauguin’s interpretation appears as a vision experienced by the Breton women, symbolized by their characteristic white headwear. The bold use of a red background emphasizes the spiritual and otherworldly encounter, transcending naturalistic depiction to convey intense emotional and religious fervor.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Gauguin employs a simplified style with flat areas of color and bold outlines, a departure from the detailed impressionistic approach. The use of color serves not just as a backdrop but actively contributes to the narrative, employing a palette that defies realism to evoke spiritual intensity and symbolic meaning. The composition divides the scene between earthly observers and the divine vision above, creating a dichotomy between reality and spirituality.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During Gauguin's time, there was a growing fascination with the 'primitive' and 'exotic,' often viewed through a colonial lens that exoticized non-Western cultures. Gauguin’s interest in Breton culture and their isolation can be seen as part of this trend, reflecting cultural inequities prevalent in French society, where rural and indigenous cultures were both romanticized and deemed inferior.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The painting metaphorically could relate to struggles with moral or spiritual 'diseases,' as the biblical confrontation exemplifies an internal battle of faith and perseverance. In a literal sense, Gauguin's later life was marked by syphilis, a condition not evident here but indicative of a personal struggle that would come to define much of his later work and life.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The internal conflict depicted through the wrestling allegory resonates with afflictions that are both spiritual and psychological. The physical struggle may signify the existential and moral battles humans face, manifesting as psychological sickness in an era where mental health was not well understood.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The biblical story resolves with Jacob transforming from his encounter, symbolizing redemption and healing. In a broader context, Gauguin sought solace and 'treatment' in his relocation to places where he perceived life as purer and less corrupted, reflecting a search for spiritual and intellectual rejuvenation.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social factors such as isolation, cultural dislocation, and the quest for spiritual identity act as determinants of the portrayed struggle. Gauguin's life itself was a reflection of seeking alternatives to the cultural maladies he perceived in Western society, revealing that many illnesses and conflicts stemmed from societal structures and personal beliefs.</p>
