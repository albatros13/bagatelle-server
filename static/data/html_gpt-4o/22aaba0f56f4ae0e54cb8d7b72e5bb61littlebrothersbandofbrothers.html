        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe:</strong> While the specific artist of this image remains unknown, it likely represents the works from an indigenous or local tribal community. Such artworks often emphasize familial life within the tribe or community, providing an intimate look into their world.</p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame):</strong> The depiction in this artwork is contemporary, reflecting everyday life in rural areas. It mirrors traditional living that has continued for centuries, where familial bonds and shared daily activities are central.</p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography:</strong> The artwork features two children, highlighting themes of care and sibling bonds. The presence of a chicken may symbolize sustenance or agricultural life, indicating a reliance on self-supplied resources.</p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design):</strong> The vibrant colors of the children's clothing create a focal point amidst a more muted, rustic background. The composition uses contrast effectively to bring attention to the children's interaction, portraying an emotive narrative with simplicity in its setting.</p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities:</strong> The artwork subtly highlights disparities faced by remote communities, particularly in terms of access to modern amenities and healthcare. The simple, traditional clothing and rural setting can evoke discussions on the economic divides affecting such areas.</p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology:</strong> While the image may not explicitly depict a disease, such contexts often bring awareness to issues of malnutrition or hygiene-related illnesses, common in rural settings due to limited resources and healthcare access.</p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness:</strong> In frames like these, one might look for signs of developmental issues or malnourishment: sallow skin, thinness, or lethargy in children, which can be subtle and require keen observation.</p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment:</strong> Addressing health issues in similar contexts involves providing nutritional support and ensuring clean water supply. Vaccinations and regular medical checkups, facilitated by clinics and outreach programs, play crucial roles.</p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness:</strong> Key determinants include access to clean water, nutritional food, education, and healthcare. The depicted environment may signal a need for improved infrastructure and economic opportunities to uplift these determinants.</p>
