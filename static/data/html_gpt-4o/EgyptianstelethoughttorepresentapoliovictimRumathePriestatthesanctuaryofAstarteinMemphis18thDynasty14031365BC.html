        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The Egyptian stele attributed to depicting Ruma the Priest is from the New Kingdom period of ancient Egypt, specifically during the 18th Dynasty, which spanned from approximately 1403 to 1365 BC. Unfortunately, identifying individual artists for such ancient works is challenging. This stele reflects the artistic conventions of a society where art was largely commissioned by the ruling class and skilled craftsmen worked in workshops to create these lasting cultural artifacts.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The 18th Dynasty of Egypt is known for its powerful pharaohs, magnificent architecture, and artistic flourish. It was a time of prosperity and cultural expansion. During this period, Memphis, one of the key locations of this stele, served as a cultural and religious hub. This timeframe also saw the construction of temples, sanctuaries, and monumental sculptures. Religion and daily life were intertwined, and artworks like this stele often depicted religious figures and ceremonies.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The stele showcases the figure of Ruma, a priest, suggesting its role as a devotional object. Hieroglyphics often accompany such images, serving to both identify the figures and provide additional context. The presence of offerings and religious symbols around Ruma signifies his role within the temple and acts of worship. Symbolically, elements like the staff he holds may indicate his authority and position as a mediator between the gods and the people.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Art during the 18th Dynasty frequently employed hierarchical proportions, with more important figures depicted at a larger scale. The composition remains balanced with the central figure commanding attention. The use of relief carving allowed for depth and detail, highlighting the skill of ancient Egyptian artisans. Symmetry and order are evident, reflecting the Egyptian world view of harmony and balance.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The artistic and cultural achievements of ancient Egypt often masked underlying social hierarchies and inequities. Priests like Ruma had significant social standing, differentiating them from commoners. Access to specialized medical care and religious roles was typically reserved for the elite, which this stele subtly underscores.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The depiction of Ruma is thought to represent a victim of polio, a disease caused by the poliovirus. The virus transmits through contaminated water and food, leading to muscle weakness and, in severe cases, paralysis. Infection often occurred during childhood, and while many recovered, others were left with disabilities.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the portrayal of Ruma, one can observe his reliance on a staff, suggesting muscle weakness or paralysis in the lower limbs—hallmark signs of poliomyelitis. This visual representation may have served not only as realistic depiction but also to invoke sympathy and respect for Ruma’s trials and perseverance.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During ancient times, treatment options were limited. Care would focus on supportive measures and rehabilitation. Priests often invoked spiritual healing, utilizing prayers and offerings to seek divine intervention. Community support and adaptive strategies would be essential for those with mobility limitations.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The prevalence of polio was linked to living conditions, including sanitation and access to clean water. Crowded environments would facilitate the spread of the virus. While polio could affect anyone, those of lower socioeconomic status might lack resources for adequate treatment or support, exacerbating the disease’s impact on their lives.</p>
