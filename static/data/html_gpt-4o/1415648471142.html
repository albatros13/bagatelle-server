        <h1>The Interplay of Art and Medicine</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork is a masterful self-portrait by Lucian Freud, a British painter known for his intense, psychologically penetrating portraits. Freud, the grandson of Sigmund Freud, was a prominent figure in the art scene of the 20th century.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This portrait was created during the late 20th century, a period marked by social upheaval and a questioning of traditional norms. Freud's work is emblematic of the shift towards more personal, introspective art that emerged during this era.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The portrait is dense with symbolism. The detailed textures of the skin could be interpreted as a reflection of the human condition, the passage of time, and the harsh realities of life. Such imagery invites viewers to confront the dualities of beauty and decay.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Freud's style is characterized by his use of impasto, a technique involving thick layers of paint that add dimension and substance. His distinctive color palette and sharp focus on anatomical precision elevate the realistic intention of the portrait.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Freud's subject matter often revolved around themes of alienation and identity. His work offers an incisive critique of societal pressures and the inequality perpetuated by social hierarchies.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While not depicting an identifiable illness, the painting’s emphasis on sagging skin and aged textures can symbolize various dermatological conditions that occur with aging, influenced by genetics and environmental stresses.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The deep creases and uneven skin represent signs of conditions such as dermatosclerosis or advanced stages of actinic damage. These reflections add a layer of scientific interest to the artwork.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment for such dermatological conditions might involve both topical and systemic interventions, aimed at managing symptoms and improving quality of life rather than curing the condition entirely.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The manifestations of such conditions are exacerbated by socioeconomic factors — access to healthcare, lifestyle choices, and exposure to environmental risks can all play a significant role in disease progression.</p>
