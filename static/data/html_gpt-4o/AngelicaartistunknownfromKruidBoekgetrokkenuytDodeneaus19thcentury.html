        <h1>Angelica from Kruid Boekgetrokkenuyt Dodeneaus</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork titled "Angelica" is an illustration from a herbarium commonly referred to as the "Kruid Boekgetrokkenuyt Dodeneaus." The artist remains unknown, which is not uncommon in historical botanical illustrations where the focus is on the accuracy of plant depiction rather than the artist's identity. These illustrations often served educational purposes, offering crucial details of plants for medicinal and academic study.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Originating from the 19th century, this illustration reflects a time when botanical studies were burgeoning due to the Age of Enlightenment's emphasis on scientific exploration and classification. During this period, Europe was experiencing a significant transformation with advancements in science and a growing interest in natural history. Botanical illustrations such as these found their place in both academic settings and among the growing middle-class curiosity for scientific and natural world understanding.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>Angelica plants, noted here, have held symbolic significance in various cultures. Traditionally, they are associated with protection and healing. Often seen as an herb with magical qualities, angelica was used for warding off evil and providing a sense of well-being. The illustration captures its roots and foliage, significant components used in traditional medicine, underlining its role in herbal healing practices.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The illustration demonstrates typical characteristics of botanical art with a focus on realistic representation. Detailed line work and soft color gradation highlight the plant's structural elements. The clarity and precision reflect the art's purpose—to educate and inform, allowing scholars and healers to distinguish among species accurately. The absence of dramatic artistic embellishments further underscores its scientific intent.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>While botanical studies were increasingly popular, access to such knowledge was predominantly reserved for the educated elite. Lower socio-economic classes had limited access to these resources, which were primarily housed in universities or private collections. Moreover, the role of women in botanical illustration, often uncredited, highlights wider societal inequities of the time.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Angelica has been used historically in the treatment of various ailments, such as digestive disorders and respiratory issues. Although not associated with a specific disease, its properties were believed to aid in the treatment of colds, fevers, and infections due to its anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting capabilities.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The inclusion of angelica in medicinal texts often pertains to its effectiveness in alleviating symptoms such as stomach cramps, coughs, and inflammations. The illustration might have served as a reference for those diagnosing or treating conditions to identify and utilize this herb effectively.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Historically, angelica was prepared in various forms including tinctures, teas, and poultices. Its roots particularly were harvested for oils believed to assist in digestive improvement and respiratory relief.
