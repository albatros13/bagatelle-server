        <h1>Organ Man with Arteries, the Stomach, and Internal Organs</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork "Organ Man with Arteries, the Stomach, and Internal Organs" is an anonymous medieval illustration. The artist's identity remains unknown, typical for many manuscripts of this era. It is believed to be part of the broader corpus of medieval medical illustrations produced by clerical scholars or monks who were tasked with the preservation and dissemination of medical knowledge during this period.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This work originates from the late Middle Ages, approximately between 1420 and 1430. During this time, Europe was experiencing significant cultural and intellectual transformations. The Catholic Church held substantial influence over education, and medical knowledge was primarily acquired through classical texts. Manuscripts like this one were critical in educating practitioners, preserving ancient Greek and Roman medical theories, and adapting them to the medieval context.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The illustration serves both as a didactic tool and a symbolic representation of human anatomy. The depiction of the human figure with internal organs highlighted in detail reflects the medieval fascination with the humoral theory - a belief that health was maintained by balancing bodily fluids. The diagrammatic portrayal also symbolizes the intersection of art and science, reverberating the idea that understanding human physiology was an essential foundation for treating illnesses.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The illustration is characterized by its linear style and flat perspective, typical of medieval artistic conventions. The emphasis is on clarity and instructional value rather than anatomical accuracy or realism. Line quality and simplified forms prioritize the legibility of the anatomical features over a naturally proportioned and lifelike depiction, which underscores its function as a pedagogical tool.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>In the Middle Ages, access to medical knowledge was limited to a privileged few, predominantly male scholars and clergy. The production and dissemination of this manuscript would have been confined to monastic institutions or wealthy patrons. Gender and class inequities were evident in the accessibility of medical education, which impacted who could provide and receive healthcare.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The manuscript is rooted in the humoral theory of medicine, which attributed diseases to the imbalance of bodily fluids: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Medieval practitioners believed that any excess or deficiency of these humors could lead to various diseases. The illustration likely accompanied texts that described ailments in terms of humoral imbalance rather than specific disease entities as understood today.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The artwork does not depict specific pathologies but offers an anatomical guide for identifying and understanding bodily functions. The inclusion of vessels and organs suggests an interest in systemic understanding, with pathologies being inferred through their impairment rather than directly visualized.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments based on the humoral theory typically involved balancing these fluids through practices like bloodletting, purging, and the administration of herbal remedies. The artwork might have been used to instruct students on where and how to administer such treatments based on the anatomy illustrated.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Illnesses during this period were often exacerbated by poor living conditions, malnutrition, and lack of sanitation—all factors tied to socioeconomic status. The manuscript would have guided treatments seen through a lens of humoral imbalance, without addressing these underlying social determinants.</p>
