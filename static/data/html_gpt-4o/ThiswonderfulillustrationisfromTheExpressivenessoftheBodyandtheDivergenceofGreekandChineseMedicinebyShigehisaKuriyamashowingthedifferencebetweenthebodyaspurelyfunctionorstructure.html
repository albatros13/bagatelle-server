        <h1>Art and Medicine: A Comparative Study</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            The illustration is a comparative work put forth by Shigehisa Kuriyama in his book, <em>The Expressiveness of the Body and the Divergence of Greek and Chinese Medicine</em>. It juxtaposes the anatomical depiction practices in Greek and Chinese traditions, reflecting two fundamentally diverse views of the body through art.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            Greek anatomical illustration is predominantly associated with the Renaissance period in Europe, a time characterized by a rebirth of classical knowledge. Andreas Vesalius, a key figure in this era, revolutionized anatomical studies with detailed illustrations of the human body. In contrast, Chinese anatomical understanding, which has a history dating back thousands of years, emphasizes the body's functionality in the context of Qi and meridians. This traditional approach aligns with holistic and integrative views of health that have persisted throughout Chinese history.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>
            The Chinese depiction uses symbols associated with meridians and acupuncture points, reflecting an understanding of the body as an interconnected web of energy channels. The Greek anatomical art, conversely, adheres to a more literal visual language, highlighting musculature and individual organs, representing the body as a complex machine.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>
            Greek artworks, illustrative of Vesalius’ style, employ realism and accurate proportions, contributing to their scientific utility. Line and shading are used to create depth and detail, enhancing the anatomical accuracy. Chinese art, while less detailed in terms of musculature, utilizes line orientation to denote energy flow, focusing on the harmony of body systems rather than structural precision.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            The divergence also reflects cultural inequities in medical understanding. Greek anatomical studies often excluded female bodies, leading to a gendered gap in health science. Traditional Chinese medicine may reflect socio-cultural hierarchies in its historical development, where access to certain practices varied according to social status and gender.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            In the context of Greek anatomy, diseases were understood as imbalances in bodily fluids (humors), often due to environmental influences or lifestyle. Chinese medicine viewed illness as an imbalance of Yin, Yang, and Qi, attributed to external factors like wind, cold, or diet, as well as internal emotional disruptions.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Greek medical practices would assess signs of illness through observable symptoms and physical examination, focusing on tangible manifestations. Chinese diagnostic techniques emphasized pulse evaluation and tongue inspection to assess internal disharmony, revealing conditions invisible to Western medical practices.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Treatments in Greek medicine were medicinally driven, relying on herbal remedies and surgical interventions. Chinese treatments, such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, and Qi Gong, targeted balance restoration within the body's energy systems. Both traditions have influenced modern integrative approaches that combine Eastern and Western practices.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            In both traditions, social determinants such as diet, lifestyle, and environmental factors profoundly influenced health outcomes. However, access to medical knowledge and care was often limited by class structures, which dictated an individual’s ability to seek effective treatment in historical societies.
