        <h2>Charles II of Spain by Juan Carreño de Miranda: An Art and Biomedical Study</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Juan Carreño de Miranda, a notable figure of the Spanish Baroque era, was an accomplished painter who served as a court artist under King Charles II of Spain. His works are esteemed for their portrayal of the Spanish nobility and court life, reflecting the distinct grandeur and intricacy that defined Baroque art.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h3>
        <p>The artwork dates back to 1685, set in the sociocultural milieu of the late Habsburg dynasty in Spain. This era signified the prelude to significant political and dynastic turmoil, with Spain grappling with internal strife and diplomatic conflicts marking the decline of its global dominance. The portrait reflects a period entrenched in political intrigue and familial intermarriages among European royals.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The portrait of Charles II, often examined for its symbolism, reflects the dual facets of power and genetic affliction. The attire and pose symbolize royal authority, yet the depiction of physical deformities underscores the consequences of continuous intra-familial marriages known for causing genetic disorders, which are emblematic of the Habsburg lineage.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>Carreño de Miranda employs a rich palette and dramatic contrast characteristic of the Baroque style. The use of chiaroscuro enhances the depth and volume of Charles II's portrait, while attention to detailed textures in clothing and facial features depict realism intertwined with idealized regality. These stylistic approaches encapsulate both grandeur and a poignant realism.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The portrait subtly foregrounds the social inequities borne from royal intermarriages, leading to hereditary defects exploited politically and socially. The invisible markers of genetic disorders on the visage of a king expose societal complications where royalty's pursuit of pure bloodlines inadvertently emphasized genetic vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Charles II was afflicted by mandibular prognathism, colloquially known as the 'Habsburg Jaw', known for protruding lower jaws and elongated faces. The etiology stems from a dominant genetic trait perpetuated by the intermarriages among Habsburg royals, exacerbated over generations, culminating in notable facial deformities and other related health issues.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The physical markers captured in Carreño de Miranda's portrait, such as the protruding jaw and weak chin, are classic signifiers of mandibular prognathism. These features were distinct not only in Charles II’s representation but were symbolic of the Habsburg lineage's paternal line.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>During Charles II's time, medical interventions for genetic deformities were rudimentary. The treatment was largely palliative, focusing on symptomatic relief rather than corrective procedures. Modern medical approaches, in contrast, might involve orthodontic treatments and surgical interventions to correct jaw alignment.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Social determinants, including the strict royal customs of maintaining 'pure bloodlines' through endogamous relationships, critically influenced the prevalence of genetic anomalies within the Habsburg dynasty. Such practices were firmly intertwined with royal prerogatives and socio-political strategies of this era.</p>
