        <h1>Luttrell Psalter Man with Crutches (1325)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            The Luttrell Psalter, created in the early 14th century, is attributed to an anonymous group of artists working in Lincolnshire, England. The Psalter was commissioned by Sir Geoffrey Luttrell, a wealthy landowner, as a means to solidify his status and legacy. The artists involved were part of a monastic or lay workshop specializing in religious manuscripts.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            The manuscript dates back to around 1325-1335, a period characterized by feudalism, religious devotion, and the burgeoning threat of the plague. This era was marked by a complex social hierarchy and the pervasive influence of the Church, which dictated much of the artistic subject matter and themes of humility and penance.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>
            The image of the man with crutches is a potent symbol within the Psalter. Crutches signify physical weakness or infirmity, but also humility and dependence on divine mercy. The surrounding figures may represent spiritual intercession, accentuating themes of piety and the church's role in addressing physical and spiritual ailments.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            The illustration showcases Gothic stylistic features, with elongated figures and an emphasis on line work. The simplicity of form contrasts with intricate decorative elements, reflecting the dual focus on readability and artistic embellishment common in illuminated manuscripts of the period.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            This artwork indirectly highlights social inequities, particularly the neglect of the sick and disabled who depended on religious charity. The depicted man's condition may symbolize the broader social neglect of those on the margins, often reliant on monasteries and church-run hospitals for care.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            The man with crutches is likely depicted with a condition such as rickets, polio, or a similar debilitating disease that affected mobility. Such conditions were prevalent due to malnutrition, insufficient healthcare, and unsanitary living conditions prevalent in medieval England.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            The presence of crutches signifies a loss of mobility and possibly muscle weakness or skeletal abnormalities typical of systemic diseases affecting bone or nerve function. The posture and gait may suggest progressive deformity associated with chronic illness.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Treatments during this period were rudimentary, often consisting of herbal remedies and prayer. Religious interpretations of illness suggested that spiritual intervention was crucial, with physical treatments limited to rudimentary practices like bone setting by monks or herbalists.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            The man’s condition reflects broader socio-economic challenges, such as inadequate nutrition, poor living conditions, and lack of medical knowledge. Social determinants like poverty and limited access to health resources exacerbated susceptibility to disease, shaping public health in medieval societies.
