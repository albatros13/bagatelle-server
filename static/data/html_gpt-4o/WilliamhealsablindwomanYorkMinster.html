        <h2>William Heals a Blind Woman - York Minster</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork "William Heals a Blind Woman" is a highly detailed piece of stained glass located in York Minster. The specific artist(s) responsible for its creation remain unidentified; however, it is characteristic of the expert craftsmanship from the medieval period when groups of glaziers would collaboratively work on their masterpieces. These anonymous artisans were usually part of localized guilds in England, known for their ornate designs and high precision.</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>This stained glass window belongs to the high Gothic period, specifically around the 13th century. The Gothic age was a time of great architectural evolution and societal change, where religious expression found its way into creative and detailed art forms, emphasizing verticality and light. The construction of York Minster itself began in the 7th century and underwent numerous expansions, reflecting the medieval Christian society that thrived amidst feudalism, and ecclesiastical influence.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The stained glass panel depicts a miracle of healing performed by Saint William. Iconographically, the bishop's mitre and crozier symbolize ecclesiastical authority and divine intervention. The act of healing a blind woman is symbolic of spiritual enlightenment and divine grace. Such imagery was designed to educate the illiterate masses on religious narratives and values, using the glass as a medium of storytelling.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>In terms of stylistic elements, the stained glass exemplifies strong use of color and light, hallmark traits of Gothic art. The predominantly red and green hues contrast magnificently, enhancing the visual narrative. The composition adheres to the Gothic style's emphasis on vertical lines and pointed arches, guiding the viewer's gaze upwards, associated with the spiritual ascent towards the divine.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The depiction of religious figures in a state of benevolence over the common folk illustrates the existing societal hierarchies. During the Gothic period, the Church wielded significant influence, often dictating social norms. Access to divine favor often portrayed by great cathedrals implied the societal hierarchies in which God's grace was administered through clerical intermediaries, highlighting the disparities in spiritual and temporal power.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The depicted condition here is blindness, possibly due to cataracts or other age-related diseases common during the medieval period. At the time, the understanding of such conditions was limited, often attributed to divine will or supernatural causes.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The artwork does not provide explicit medical details, but implies blindness through the posture and pleading gesture of the woman, common artistic shorthand for infirmity. Her head is bowed, possibly suggesting reliance and desperation for a miraculous remedy.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>In the context of the time, there were few effective treatments for blindness. Treatments were mostly rudimentary and based on traditional knowledge which included herbal remedies and spiritual cures; however, miracles attributed to saints were considered the most potent cures.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Blindness and other conditions during this period were influenced by social determinants such as access to nutrition, healthcare, and living conditions. Often the poor were more susceptible to diseases due to undernourishment and lack of medical care.</p>
