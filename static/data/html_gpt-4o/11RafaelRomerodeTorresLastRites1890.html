        <h2>Rafael Romerode Torres - Last Rites (1890)</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Rafael Romero de Torres was a Spanish painter, known for his exquisite skill in conveying poignant human emotions through his works. Born in the late 19th century, he became an eminent figure in Spanish art, contributing significantly to the art scene with his realistic and emotionally evocative style.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>The painting "Last Rites" was created in 1890, a period characterized by rapid industrialization and growing social awareness in Spain. The socio-cultural environment of the time was marked by a dichotomy between modernity and traditionalism, which was reflected in art, literature, and daily life.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h3>
        <p>In "Last Rites," the symbolism revolves around the themes of mortality and faith. The presence of the priest administering the final rites signifies religious solace, while the somber expressions of the onlookers reflect the gravity of death. The lanterns could symbolize the guiding light of faith in dark times.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>Romero de Torres employed a realistic style with meticulous attention to detail, emphasizing naturalistic textures and subtle shading. The composition is arranged to draw the viewer’s eye towards the central figure, using lighting contrasts to highlight the emotional intensity of the scene.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The painting subtly addresses social inequities, hinting at the stratified nature of 19th-century Spanish society. The modest surroundings of the dying man may indicate his lower social standing, a stark contrast to the religious figure in ceremonial attire, highlighting disparities in social and economic status.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Though the exact illness depicted is not specified, the bandages and the male's condition suggest a severe, possibly infectious disease common in the 19th century. It reflects the limited medical knowledge and medical care accessibility of the time, indicating a possible high mortality rate from common illnesses.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The signs depicted in the artwork, such as the bandages and the frail, exposed condition of the man, illustrate the physical debilitation of disease. These elements highlight the severity of his condition, emphasizing the impact of disease on both the individual and their family.</p>
        
        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>During the 19th century, treatments were rudimentary, often involving basic bandaging and reliance on religious and spiritual solace, as depicted in the painting. Faith and prayer were crucial components of coping with illness in an era with limited medical interventions.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The painting suggests underlying social determinants such as poverty, access to healthcare, and living conditions as factors influencing health outcomes. These determinants often dictated the severity and progression of illnesses, especially in lower socio-economic groups.</p>
