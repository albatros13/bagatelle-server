        <h1>Rembrandt van Rijn Self Portrait</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn was a Dutch painter, widely regarded as one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art. His work spanned the fields of portraiture, landscape, and narrative paintings.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>This self-portrait was created in the 17th century, a period known as the Dutch Golden Age. The Netherlands experienced unprecedented wealth and cultural achievement, with art playing a significant role in society.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>Rembrandt's self-portraits often symbolized introspection and the human condition, reflecting his personal struggles and triumphs. His gaze in the portrait challenges the viewer to consider the passage of time and life experiences.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The portrait features a mastery of chiaroscuro, the use of strong contrasts between light and dark to achieve a sense of volume and depth. The rich texture and attention to detail highlight Rembrandt's skill in capturing the essence of his subjects.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Despite the wealth of the Dutch Golden Age, there were significant social inequalities. Artists like Rembrandt, while successful, were subject to economic fluctuations and personal hardships that influenced their work.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>In this portrait, Rembrandt may be depicting signs of a lazy eye, depression, and other age-related conditions. Amblyopia, commonly known as lazy eye, is often congenital and results in decreased vision in one eye.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The portrait potentially shows signs of amblyopia through the misalignment of the eyes. The somber expression and dark palette could suggest an exploration of depression, a topic not uncommon in Rembrandt's studies of human emotion.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Rembrandt's time, treatment for a lazy eye was minimal, as modern optical solutions were not available. Depression was similarly misunderstood and went untreated, often being seen as a personal fault rather than a medical condition.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and social capital could have influenced Rembrandt’s health conditions. These determinants often impact the progression and management of diseases.</p>
