        <h2>Art and Science Analysis</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>
            The artwork titled "Statue Showing Elephantiasis of the Scrotum" is an anonymous creation dating back to the 19th century. This piece is likely attributed to an African tribe or ethnic group known for its intricate bronze sculptures. With the identity of the artist remaining ambiguous, it reflects the communal nature of art-making practices inherent to many traditional societies in Africa. These artists were often part of a lineage that carried on the skills and techniques through generations.
        </p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>
            During the 19th century, Africa was experiencing significant socio-political upheavals due to colonial activities. This period saw numerous cultural exchanges and disruptions. Artworks served as documentation of societal issues, health problems, and deities. Art pieces like this one were not only expressions of cultural identity but also educational tools that represented realities of the community's health and lifestyle challenges.
        </p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
        <p>
            The statue highlights a medical condition known as elephantiasis, notably affecting the scrotum. Symbolically, it serves as a testament to both the human condition and communal endurance in the face of adversity. The exaggerated depiction of the ailment is indicative of a broader cultural narrative about confronting bodily ailments and perhaps serves as an icon for a deity of healing.
        </p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>
            The statue is rendered in a stylized form reminiscent of African artistic traditions. The exaggerated proportions, simplified lines, and emphasis on texture echo characteristics of African sculpture. These design principles work to communicate both the physical severity of elephantiasis and a broader cultural aesthetic valuing abstraction and symbolism over realism.
        </p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>
            This piece also encapsulates the social inequities regarding healthcare access at the time. Elephantiasis, primarily caused by parasitic infections, is preventable and treatable; however, the persistence of this condition suggests limited medical intervention available to the affected populations, likely due to colonial neglect or discrimination.
        </p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>
            Elephantiasis, or lymphatic filariasis, is caused by parasitic worms transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. The scarring and blockage of lymphatic vessels result in severe swelling, most commonly of the legs and genitals. This social and physically debilitating condition affects millions worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical regions.
        </p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>
            The immense swelling depicted in the sculpture is a direct signifier of the condition’s impact. Infected individuals often endure physical incapacitation, leading to further social stigma and isolation. The artwork’s portrayal of this condition not only informs but also elicits empathy and understanding from viewers.
        </p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>
            Treatment for elephantiasis involves administering anti-parasitic medications such as diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, or albendazole. In addition, preventing secondary infections and managing symptoms with rigorous hygiene, elevation of limbs, and compression are essential. Community-wide mass drug administration campaigns have been effective in reducing disease prevalence.
        </p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>
            Poverty, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and limited education contribute to the prevalence of elephantiasis. These factors hinder prevention, early detection, and effective treatment in affected populations. The statue serves as a poignant reminder of the intertwined nature of health and socio-economic status.
