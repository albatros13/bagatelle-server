        <h1>Oedipus and Antigone or the Plague of Thebes by Charles François Jalabert</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Charles François Jalabert (1819–1901) was a notable French painter of the 19th century, associated with the academic art tradition. His works often depicted historical, mythological, and biblical scenes, showcasing his adept skill in portraying dramatic narratives and human emotion. Jalabert was known for his precise draftsmanship and ability to convey complex themes through his art.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created during the mid-19th century, "Oedipus and Antigone or the Plague of Thebes" is reflective of a period where classical themes experienced a resurgence in European art. The mid-1800s were marked by a romantic fascination with ancient Greece and Rome, and artists sought to explore the moral and philosophical questions raised by classic literature. This work specifically draws on themes present in Sophocles’ tragedies, which were revered for their exploration of fate and human suffering.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting is rich in symbolic content. Oedipus is depicted as a blind, tragic hero, embodying the frailty of human condition and the inescapable nature of fate. Antigone’s presence symbolizes loyalty and familial duty. The backdrop of Thebes with its suffering populace highlights the chaos and despair of a city stricken by plague. The figures in the foreground suggest various responses to the plague, from desperation to pleading for divine intervention.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Jalabert’s style in this painting demonstrates classical precision and romantic expressiveness. The composition employs a harmonious balance, guiding the viewer’s eye across the scene. The use of chiaroscuro enhances the drama, with strong contrasts between light and shadow emphasizing the emotional intensity of the figures. The use of color is muted yet effective in conveying the somber mood of the narrative.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The artwork indirectly comments on social disparities, depicting both the nobility and the suffering common populace. It highlights the societal challenges and hierarchies that persisted, even in times of common crisis such as a plague. The elite, represented by Oedipus, are contrasted with the destitute citizens of Thebes, showcasing the disparities in blame, responsibility, and suffering.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The depicted plague likely references historical accounts of epidemics, with symptoms akin to that of classical descriptions such as fever, delirium, and death. In the context of Thebes, the plague can be seen as divine punishment, spurred on by moral failings and societal corruption, a common theme in Greek mythology.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The painting illustrates varied signs of illness, from the pale, weakened figures to those rendered immobile by their condition. The artist captures the somber pallor and gestures of despair, typical representations of a society in the grips of a deadly epidemic.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The treatment of plagues in ancient times was limited to rudimentary methods such as purification rituals, sacrificial offerings, and appeals to the gods. Medical understanding was not advanced, making the intervention mostly spiritual or symbolic.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Jalabert’s work reflects several social determinants of health, including living conditions, governance, and religious interpretive frameworks, which influence the spread and management of the plague. The social structure of Thebes is a critical element affecting the distribution and impact of illness.</p>
