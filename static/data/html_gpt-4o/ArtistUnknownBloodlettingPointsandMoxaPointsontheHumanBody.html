        <h1>Bloodletting and Moxa Points on the Human Body</h1>
        <p><strong>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe:</strong> The artwork is attributed to an unknown artist, potentially of Tibetan or Himalayan origin. Traditional Tibetan medicine and Buddhist practices often utilized such illustrations, indicating the cultural and spiritual importance placed on medical practices at the time.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame):</strong> This image likely originates from around the 17th to 19th century when Tibetan medicine was gaining prominence. It was a period marked by the interchange of medical knowledge across Asia, reflecting both ancient Indian Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) influences.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography:</strong> The chart symbolizes the intricate connection between medical knowledge and spiritual well-being. Each point and path represents energy flows or “meridians,” essential in balancing the body’s physical and spiritual state. Bloodletting and moxibustion points serve dual roles of medical therapy and spiritual purification.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/principles of design):</strong> The artwork showcases a simplistic yet strong use of line and color to denote important bodily points. The symmetrical presentation empowers the balance theme, using frontal poses commonly found in medical and spiritual depictions of the era. The illustrative style is functional, guiding healers in precise practices.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities:</strong> Access to such medical treatments was often limited to those within monastic or wealthy circles. The spread of medical texts, however, facilitated broader knowledge dissemination, though inequalities persisted based on location, social status, and gender roles within traditional settings.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology:</strong> The medical system depicted emphasizes the regulation of bodily humors and energies. Diseases are seen as imbalances potentially rectified through bloodletting and moxibustion, aligning bodily elements harmoniously to maintain health.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness:</strong> The image’s detailed point mapping was used diagnostically to identify symptoms presenting in various body areas. Discrete markings suggest focal points for intervention, addressing imbalances in blood or “energy” stagnation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[h] Treatment:</strong> Bloodletting was believed to release toxins, while moxibustion, applying heat to specific points, stimulated blood flow and empowered the body’s natural healing process. Such treatments straddled lines between medical intervention and spiritual practice, reflective of cultural beliefs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness:</strong> Socio-economic status, geographical location, and religious access greatly influenced treatment availability. The interplay of these factors with environmental and dietary components dictated overall health, emphasizing a holistic approach common to Tibetan medicinal views.</p>
