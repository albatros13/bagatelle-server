        <h1>Lam Qua Art Analysis</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Lam Qua, a pioneering Chinese artist, was renowned for his medical portraiture in the 19th century. He collaborated with Western physicians, particularly Peter Parker, to document unusual medical cases. His paintings served both artistic and educational purposes.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The artwork was created in 1836, during a period when Western influence was beginning to expand in China. This era saw a fusion of Eastern and Western medical practices. Lam Qua's works provided crucial insights into medical conditions and treatments during the Qing dynasty.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting symbolizes the intersection of art and medicine. The detailed portrayal of the tumor highlights medical curiosity and emphasizes the stark reality of human ailments. The subject's composed expression reflects resilience and acceptance.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Lam Qua's realistic style is evident in his meticulous attention to detail. The use of monochromatic tones draws focus to the physical abnormality, while the balanced composition accentuates both the subject's vulnerability and strength.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The subject depicted may have faced social marginalization due to his condition. This highlights the attitudes toward illness and disability in 19th-century Chinese society, where individuals with visible afflictions often experienced stigmatization.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The subject has a large tumor, possibly a neurofibroma, which is a nerve sheath tumor. Neurofibromas can result from genetic conditions such as Neurofibromatosis Type 1, which often manifests in childhood and leads to diverse symptomatic expressions.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The protrusion and discoloration of the left arm signify a significant mass effect. The depiction shows typical symptoms like skin discoloration, asymmetry, and swelling, indicating the illness's impact on the patient’s life.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the 19th century, surgical removal of such tumors was the primary treatment option, albeit with significant risk. Given the limited medical technology, treatments often resulted in complications. Modern medicine now offers safer surgical interventions and genetic counseling.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as limited access to healthcare, prevailing socio-economic conditions, and cultural beliefs shaped the experience and treatment of illnesses in historical China. These determinants played a crucial role in the life quality of those affected by such conditions.</p>
