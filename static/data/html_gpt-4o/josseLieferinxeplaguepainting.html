        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis of Josse Lieferinxe's Plague Painting</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Josse Lieferinxe, a South Netherlandish painter of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, was renowned for his religious and historical depictions. His works were deeply woven into the fabric of medieval socio-religious life, offering vivid representations of Christian narratives and societal conditions of his era.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h3>
        <p>This painting is believed to be part of a sequence created around the early 16th century, a period marked by recurrent plagues that devastated Europe. The painting illustrates the societal dread and reliance on divine intervention during outbreaks when medical understanding was rudimentary.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The artwork prominently features divine figures, possibly representing saints or angels, indicative of the medieval reliance on spiritual salvation during disasters. The town’s backdrop and the portrayal of individuals in distress resonate with the chaos wrought by the plague.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>Lieferinxe's use of perspective and detailed representation of architectural elements emphasize depth. The somber color palette and dynamic composition, with figures in varying postures, enhance the emotional gravity, directing the viewer’s focus toward the narrative of disease and despair.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The painting implicitly highlights the stark class distinctions in medieval society. The attire of figures suggests varied social standings, underscoring disparities in access to resources, care, and spiritual intercession during outbreaks.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The painting reflects the impact of the bubonic plague, caused by the bacterium <em>Yersinia pestis</em>. Transmitted through fleas living on rats, the disease was characterized by swelling (buboes), fever, and high mortality rates.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Visual markers in the painting depict afflicted individuals in agony, revealing the physical manifestations of the plague. The postures and expressions convey helplessness, with some figures perhaps displaying the characteristic buboes.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>During the period, treatment options were predominantly spiritual rather than medical. Reliance on prayers, processions, and relics was common as actual medical solutions were unavailable. Quarantines and rudimentary public health measures were sometimes enacted but with limited understanding.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The spread of the plague was exacerbated by crowded living conditions, poor sanitation, and limited medical knowledge. Economic inequalities affected access to care, with the wealthy having better chances of protection and treatment.</p>
