        <h1>Art Historical and Medical Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork is a historical medical illustration, possibly created by a medical illustrator from the 19th or early 20th century. Medical illustrations from this period were often produced by illustrators working closely with physicians and were housed in medical textbooks or journals.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This illustration likely dates back to a time when medical illustration was crucial for the education of physicians before the advent of modern photography. This period saw significant developments in the understanding and treatment of diseases, and illustrations were an essential part of sharing this knowledge across various medical spheres.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The illustration serves a didactic purpose, aiming to depict the clinical manifestations of hereditary syphilis. There is no artistic symbolism; rather, the focus is on accurately presenting the physical attributes of the condition to educate and inform medical practitioners or the public.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The illustration exhibits precise line work and attention to detail, highlighting the symptoms seen on the subject's face. This style is typical of medical illustrations used for educational purposes, where clarity and accuracy are paramount. The composition draws attention to the affected areas, making the medical implications of the condition clear and comprehensible.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The illustration raises awareness about hereditary syphilis, a disease that historically affected marginalized populations more acutely due to lack of access to medical care, stigma, and socioeconomic factors. These factors contributed to disparities in disease management and prevalence within different social groups.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Hereditary syphilis, also known as congenital syphilis, is passed from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy. It is caused by the bacterium <em>Treponema pallidum</em>. If untreated, it can lead to severe consequences in infants, including physical and neurological damage.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The signs depicted in the illustration include facial deformities, such as flattening of the nose and skin rashes, which are characteristic of congenital syphilis. Such illustrations were key in diagnosing and studying the progression of the disease at a time when laboratory diagnostics were limited.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the time this illustration was likely created, treatments were limited to mercury and other less effective methods. Modern treatment includes antibiotics, particularly penicillin, which is effective in treating syphilis at any stage.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Congenital syphilis is influenced by social determinants such as poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and education. These factors often lead to inadequate prenatal care and untreated maternal syphilis, resulting in higher incidences of congenital cases.</p>
