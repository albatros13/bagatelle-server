        <h1>A Historical and Biomedical Examination of "A Girl in the London Asylum Suffering from Chronic Pellagra"</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork, attributed to Louis Sambon, a prominent figure in medical illustration, captures the harrowing experience of a young girl afflicted by pellagra. This piece is not just a work of art but also a document of medical history, shedding light on the intersection of art and science.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Pellagra was prevalent in the early 20th century, particularly in areas where maize was a staple food devoid of essential nutrients. The time period saw many individuals in asylums suffering from chronic diseases due to nutritional deficiencies, exacerbated by socio-economic conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The imagery is stark, emphasizing the frailty and vulnerability of the subject. The emaciated form, sullen expression, and skin lesions symbolize the ravaging effects of the disease. It serves as a reminder of the plight faced by many due to ignorance about nutrition and healthcare.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Using muted colors and soft lines, the artist conveys an atmosphere of somberness and melancholy. The meticulous detailing of the skin’s texture focuses on realism, aiming to evoke empathy and understanding of the girl’s condition.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The presence of pellagra among the poor highlighted significant social disparities. Those in lower socio-economic groups lacked access to diversified diets, healthcare, and education about nutritional needs. The asylum setting underscores these inequities, as many who were institutionalized suffered from preventable conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Pellagra is a disease caused by niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency, characterized by dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. It often occurred where diets were heavily reliant on corn, which lacks available niacin unless properly treated. The malnutrition precipitated systemic issues, exemplified in the afflicted individuals.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The girl’s scaly and inflamed skin, evident in the painting, signals pellagra’s dermatological impact. Mental confusion and emotional distress, although not visually depicted, were common complications indicative of the disease’s severe neurological effects.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the early 1900s, treatment included dietary changes to incorporate niacin-rich foods like meat, fish, and enriched grains. The understanding of pellagra’s link to diet paved the way for fortification programs, drastically reducing its incidence and severity in affected regions.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Poverty, lack of education, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure were critical social determinants that contributed to pellagra’s prevalence. These factors hindered access to proper nutrition and medical intervention, prolonging suffering and further entrenching societal inequities.</p>
