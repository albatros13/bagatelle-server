        <h2>Charles Eisenmann Studio (1880)</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The photograph originates from the famed Charles Eisenmann Studio, established in the 19th century in New York. Eisenmann was known for photographing figures from various sideshows, capturing human anomalies within the context of his time. His work was crucial in documenting marginalized communities who were often presented in exhibitions of so-called "freak shows."</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>The photograph dates back to the 1880s, a period marked by widespread fascination with sideshow performers. During this time, individuals who had congenital disabilities or variations were often displayed in vaudeville circuits. This era was also deeply embedded in the pseudo-science narratives of phrenology and eugenics, theories that sadly justified and perpetuated discrimination against those with differences.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
        <p>The subject in the photograph holds a rifle, symbolizing strength and resilience, perhaps hinting at the individual’s autonomy and defiance against societal norms. The presence of a young boy with physical differences is a direct commentary on societal attitudes towards physical appearance and capabilities during that era.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>The sepia tones and the soft focus style are instrumental in creating a nostalgic yet somber atmosphere. The artwork primarily relies on simple composition, spotlighting the subject in a solitary pose that draws attention to the complexities and depth of individual identity apart from external judgment.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>This photograph underscores the inequities faced by individuals with disabilities. During this period, they were often denied proper medical care, education, and societal acceptance, being instead subject to exploitation for entertainment purposes. Such inequities reflect broader societal failures in acknowledging and appreciating individual differences.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The image presents a young individual with a limb difference, likely a congenital condition resulting in limb reduction. These conditions can be caused by genetic mutations or environmental factors during fetal development. During the 19th century, understanding of these medical conditions was limited.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The visible signifier in the photograph is the underdeveloped limb. In historical context, such physical characteristics were often misinterpreted or mystified due to lack of scientific knowledge, rather than seen as a medical condition needing medical understanding and personal empathy.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>In the 1880s, treatments for congenital conditions were rudimentary. The lack of knowledge often led to the neglect of these conditions. It wasn't until much later that prosthetics and other medical advancements began to adequately address physical differences.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Significant social determinants include education and economic status. Many individuals with disabilities faced systemic barriers limiting their access to quality education and employment opportunities, contributing to their marginalization and limiting long-term health outcomes.</p>
