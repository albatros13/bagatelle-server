        <h1>Dalton Rash of Sores 1858</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork, "Dalton Rash of Sores 1858," is attributed to an anonymous artist from the mid-19th century. During this time, medical illustrations were often created by individuals skilled in both the arts and sciences. The artist’s primary aim was not only to display artistic skill but to provide a scientific documentation of disease phenomena.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This artwork dates back to the year 1858, a period marked by the burgeoning field of medical science. The 19th century was a time of significant advances in medical understanding, with increased emphasis on anatomical study and the classification of diseases. This was the era of the Industrial Revolution, during which rapid urbanization brought about significant public health challenges.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The depiction of a bare back covered with sores symbolizes vulnerability and the impact of illness on human dignity. During the 19th century, visual representations of diseases were both educational and symbolic. The rash detailed in this illustration suggests an emphasis on realism, likely symbolizing the data-driven and empirical approaches of the time.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>This artwork employs a realist style, characterized by detailed and lifelike representation. The use of line and color emphasizes the texture and severity of the rash. The somber color palette and the deliberate choice of a neutral background draw the viewer’s focus towards the skin condition, underscoring the scientific intent of the artwork.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>In the 19th century, the understanding and treatment of diseases were often influenced by socio-economic status. Access to medical care was largely determined by class, with poorer individuals suffering disproportionately. Illustrations like this one often served both as educational tools and as a reflection of the social inequalities inherent in medical care access at the time.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The rash depicted in the illustration could be indicative of various conditions common in the 19th century, such as smallpox, syphilis, or a severe dermatitis. These diseases were often associated with overcrowding and poor sanitation, critical issues during the era's rapid urban expansion.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The visible sores and discoloration in the artwork likely symbolize symptomatic indicators of a dermatological condition. Such illustrations were crucial for physicians, providing a visual reference to diagnose and understand symptoms of diseases that could not be verbally communicated accurately.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments in the 19th century were rudimentary by modern standards, often involving herbal remedies, mercury compounds, or other early pharmaceutical interventions. The knowledge conveyed through works like "Dalton Rash of Sores" helped improve diagnostic accuracy, though effective treatments for many conditions were still years away.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as poverty, living conditions, and occupation greatly influenced the prevalence and spread of diseases. This artwork serves as a reminder of the historical impact of these social determinants on health, highlighting the critical need for addressing such issues in public health reforms.</p>
