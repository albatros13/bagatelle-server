        <h2>Votive Stele of Mother Fainting After Childbirth</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artist who created the "Votive Stele of Mother Fainting After Childbirth" is unknown, as is typical with many artifacts from the Classical Period in Greek art. During this era, artworks were often collaborative efforts signed by workshop masters, if at all. This particular stele belongs to a long tradition of Greek marble work, indicative of a skilled artist likely associated with a reputable atelier.</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h3>
        <p>The stele originates from the late 5th century BCE, a time of significant cultural development in Greece. The Classical Period is often celebrated for its advancements in philosophy, politics, and the arts. This era saw Athens at the height of its power, with monumental building projects like the Parthenon. The socio-cultural context was heavily influenced by polytheistic religious practices, where votive offerings played a significant role.</p>
        
        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The stele depicts a woman fainting after childbirth, a common yet profound experience. The presence of attendants suggests both care and the significance of the mother’s health in societal continuity. Iconographically, it represents themes of fertility, family, and perhaps the vulnerability associated with childbirth. The relief employs classic Greek artistic symbolism, where figures are idealized yet expressive.</p>
        
        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>The stele exemplifies the Classical Greek style, noted for its emphasis on proportion and balance. The composition is orderly, with figures arranged to guide the viewer's eye towards the central theme of maternal vulnerability. The use of relief carving enhances depth and realism, characteristic of the period’s focus on humanism and naturalism.</p>
        
        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>While the artwork highlights the maternal experience, it subtly underscores the gender dynamics of the period. Women were often confined to domestic spheres, with their roles largely defined by their functions in reproduction and household management. The depiction of childbirth in art signifies both the revered and constrained nature of women’s roles.</p>
        
        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The fainting depicted may be indicative of postpartum complications, such as hemorrhage or postnatal exhaustion, common issues given the lack of advanced medical care. These ailments were understood through a rudimentary knowledge of medicine based on humoral theory, where imbalances affected health.</p>
        
        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The primary signifier depicted is the woman’s fainting posture. In a period lacking in detailed medical iconography, this physical depiction serves as a visual shorthand for physical weakness following childbirth.</p>
        
        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>During the Classical Period, treatments would have included herbal remedies, rest, and ritual purification. Midwives often played critical roles in postnatal care, although their practices combined traditional knowledge with prevailing superstitions and religious beliefs.</p>
        
        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Illnesses like those depicted in the stele were influenced by social determinants such as class, access to nutritious food, and the quality of care available. Wealthier families had better access to medical knowledge and practices, whereas lower-class individuals might rely more heavily on communal or traditional help.</p>
