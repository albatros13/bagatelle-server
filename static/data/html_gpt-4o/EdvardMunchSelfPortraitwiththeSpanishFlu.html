        <h2>Edvard Munch Self Portrait with the Spanish Flu</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h3>
        <p>Edvard Munch, the Norwegian artist renowned for his evocative treatment of psychological themes, is best known for his iconic work "The Scream". Munch experienced illness and death in his family at an early age, which deeply influenced his later work, infusing it with a profound existential quality.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>This painting was completed during the period of the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919, a global catastrophe that killed millions across the world. The pandemic coincided with, and was exacerbated by, the aftermath of World War I, which significantly shaped societal norms and artistic expressions in the early 20th century.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>In "Self Portrait with the Spanish Flu", Munch uses bold colors to symbolize the stark contrasts between life and death, health and illness. The somber tones and a slightly distorted form reflect the emotional and physical turmoil faced by the artist during his recovery from the illness.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>Munch employs expressionist techniques, characterized by vivid color saturation and experimental use of line, to convey an emotional truth rather than an objective reality. His technique of layering colors suggests both depth and transparency, exemplifying his struggle and resilience.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The Spanish flu pandemic exposed underlying societal inequities, with economic disparities significantly influencing access to healthcare and survival. Munch’s work reflects these inequities in his depiction of vulnerability and isolation, common experiences during that time.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The Spanish flu was caused by an H1N1 influenza virus. Highly contagious, it spread rapidly across countries, confined to close quarters, often exacerbated by wartime conditions, affecting otherwise healthy young adults at an alarming rate.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Munch’s portrayal includes physical signs of illness such as pallor and weakness, symbolized through the slumped posture and the thinness of his form. This narrative captures both the personal and universal struggle against the pandemic.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>During the Spanish flu, treatment options were rudimentary, focusing on supportive care like rest, nutrition, and hydration. Without antivirals or vaccines, survival largely depended on individual immune responses and social conditions.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The impact of the Spanish flu was uneven across different socio-economic groups, heavily influenced by living conditions, healthcare accessibility, and occupational exposures. Munch’s depiction emphasizes this disparity, highlighting resilience amidst adversity.</p>
