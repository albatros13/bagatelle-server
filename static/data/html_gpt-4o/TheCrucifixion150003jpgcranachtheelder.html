        <h1>The Crucifixion (1500–03) by Lucas Cranach the Elder</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Lucas Cranach the Elder, a prominent German Renaissance artist, crafted "The Crucifixion" between 1500 and 1503. He was renowned for his portraits, religious scenes, and role as the court painter for the Electors of Saxony. His work spanned the later Gothic and early Renaissance periods, characterized by vivid realism and intricate detailing.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This artwork emerges from the early 16th century, a period marked by religious upheaval and the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation. The time was rich with artistic innovation, as it straddled medieval traditions while embracing Renaissance humanism. Cranach played a pivotal part in the artistic representation of the Reformation, often collaborating with Martin Luther.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>"The Crucifixion" is filled with symbolic meaning, capturing the central event in Christian theology. The depiction of Jesus on the cross amidst thieves symbolizes sacrifice and redemption. The presence of figures like Mary and John the Apostle represents mourning and devotion, while the stark contrast in expressions highlights themes of divine suffering versus earthly sin.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Cranach's use of color and line is particularly notable. The dramatic use of light and shadow creates a stark contrast, enhancing the emotional intensity of the scene. His detailed rendering of figures breaks away from medieval traditions, embracing a more lifelike and human-centered approach, characteristic of the Northern Renaissance.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The crucifixion, as depicted, reflects the socio-cultural tensions of its time, especially religious divisions. While it embodies the ideals of sacrifice and redemption, it also underscores the inequities of Roman power and oppression. The marginalized position of characters reflects broader societal hierarchies.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Art from this period frequently depicted various illnesses. Although "The Crucifixion" does not overtly display disease, its era dealt with frequent outbreaks like the bubonic plague. Such diseases often symbolized divine wrath or societal decay and played a role in shaping the art narrative of suffering and redemption.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In Renaissance art, physical deformities or ailments depicted in characters often served allegorical functions—representing moral or spiritual failings. In such works, signs of crucifixion wounds could echo themes of human frailty and suffering.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment in the early 16th century was rudimentary. Remedies were often based on herbal concoctions and religious interventions. Artworks sometimes doubled as pedagogical tools, illustrating beneficial practices or cautionary tales related to health and morality.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Disease in Cranach’s time was heavily influenced by factors such as poverty, sanitation, and public health systems, which were rudimentary at best. These elements deeply affected artistic portrayals, invoking sympathy and often serving as a critique of contemporary societal conditions.</p>
