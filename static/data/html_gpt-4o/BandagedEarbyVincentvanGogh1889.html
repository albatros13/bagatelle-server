        <h1>Bandaged Ear by Vincent van Gogh (1889)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        <p>Vincent van Gogh, a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter, is one of the most famous figures in Western art. Despite having created more than 2,100 artworks over a decade, he gained fame posthumously. His work is known for its raw emotion, bold colors, and dramatic, impulsive, and expressive brushwork.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted in 1889, "Bandaged Ear" was a product of van Gogh’s residence in Arles, France, during a tumultuous period in his life. This was the time when van Gogh had a breakdown, which led to the infamous incident where he cut off a portion of his left ear following an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The bandaged ear is a powerful symbol of his vulnerability and turmoil. This self-portrait captures his psychological state and reflects both physical pain and deeper psychological distress. The backdrop often includes Japanese prints, revealing van Gogh's admiration for Japanese art and its influence on his style.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Van Gogh utilized bold, thick brushstrokes and a vibrant color palette to convey emotion and movement. The composition’s intense colors and dynamic lines symbolize his internal struggle, employing elements such as contrasting colors and a focus on texture to portray depth.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Van Gogh's life was marked by poverty and mental illness, drawing attention to the broader conversations about mental health and societal indifference of the time. His lack of recognition during his lifetime is a testament to the disconnect between societal values and individual brilliance.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Vincent van Gogh is speculated to have suffered from various mental disorders including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. The incident with the ear is speculated to be a result of an acute mental crisis, which may have been exacerbated by physical exhaustion and malnutrition.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The bandaged ear symbolizes self-harm associated with severe psychological distress. It signifies the physical manifestations of his mental illness at a time when such conditions were largely misunderstood and stigmatized.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During van Gogh’s time, understanding and treatment of mental illness were limited. Following the incident, he was admitted to a hospital where he received rudimentary care. Artistic expression served as his personal therapy, a way to cope with his turmoil.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Van Gogh’s mental and physical health were aggravated by social isolation, financial instability, and the pressure of his ambitions. The lack of a support system intensified the effects of his disorders, demonstrating the impact of social factors on health.</p>
