        <h1>Art and Science in 19th Century Medical Practice</h1>
        
        <h2>a. Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        The business card for "Mr. & Mrs. Bese, Cuppers & Leechers" is an artifact from the 19th-century medical trade. Though not attributed to a professional artist, this card reflects the craft of printmaking and design typical of advertising in the era. It would have been produced by a local printer skilled in woodblock or metal plate engraving.

        <h2>b. Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        The card originates from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during the 19th century—a time of burgeoning industrialization and medical experimentation. This period saw traditional practices like bloodletting and leech therapy holding over from earlier centuries even as modern medicine began to develop. The business card speaks to the commercial aspects of healthcare, as such services were often administered by individuals outside the formal medical establishment.

        <h2>c. Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        The card’s imagery includes lush vegetation and flowing water, symbolically evoking natural healing and purification. Leeches, depicted on the card, are the iconic representation of a once-common therapeutic practice—suggesting the removal of impurities through bloodletting.

        <h2>d. Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        The design features balanced composition and detailed line work typical of 19th-century engravings. The use of bold serif text signifies importance, while the botanical illustrations suggest a harmony between man and nature. The monochrome palette, dictated by the print method, relies on contrast to create visibility and emphasis.

        <h2>e. Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        This card reflects a time when access to formal medical care was limited for many, particularly for lower-income individuals who often resorted to folk practices. Leeching and cupping were popular for their perceived effectiveness and affordability, highlighting inequities in healthcare access and education in the period.

        <h2>f. Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        Bloodletting, through cupping and leeching, was believed to treat various conditions, ranging from fevers to inflammation and hypertension. This practice was rooted in the humoral theory of medicine which posited that health depended on the balance of bodily fluids.

        <h2>g. Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        Conditions treated by leeching often involved visible signs of swelling or erythema, indicating inflammation or excess blood according to contemporaneous beliefs. Leeches were used to draw out blood, theoretically alleviating symptoms of congestion or imbalance.

        <h2>h. Treatment</h2>
        Leech therapy involved applying live leeches to specific points on the body, where they would attach and draw blood. Cupping involved creating suction on the skin, often with heated glass jars, purportedly to draw toxins from the body and improve circulation.

        <h2>i. Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        The reliance on practitioners like Mr. & Mrs. Bese underscores the socioeconomic determinants of health during this era; many turned to affordable, accessible treatments offered by local entrepreneurs rather than trained physicians due to cost and availability.
