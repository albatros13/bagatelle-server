        <h1>Jean Baptiste Deshays - Death of Hercules</h1>
        
        <h2>a. Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        Jean Baptiste Deshays, a prominent French painter of the 18th century, is renowned for his contributions to the Rococo movement. His work "Death of Hercules" exemplifies the dramatic expression characteristic of this era.

        <h2>b. Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        Created in 1762, this painting belongs to the Rococo period, a time when art transitioned from the grandeur of the Baroque to more intimate, light-hearted themes. The socio-political landscape was marked by Enlightenment ideals, influencing the way art was perceived and appreciated.

        <h2>c. Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        The artwork captures the mythological tale of Hercules' demise, symbolizing strength and vulnerability. Hercules' poisoned garment, a pivotal element in the painting, can be interpreted as a metaphor for the hero's unintended downfall, echoing human fragility.

        <h2>d. Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        The fluid brushwork and dynamic composition characteristic of Rococo art are evident. Deshays utilized warm, rich colors and exaggerated poses to imbue the piece with emotion and movement, aligning with the Rococo aesthetic that encouraged sensuality and exuberance.

        <h2>e. Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        While Rococo art often portrayed a carefree lifestyle, it masked the social inequities of the period. The aristocracy's lavishness depicted in such artworks contrasts with the struggles of the lower classes, disenfranchised from the wealth and prosperities.

        <h2>f. Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        The transdermal poisoning of Hercules, as depicted, serves as a narrative device reflecting real biomedical concerns. In myth, Hercules was poisoned by a garment smeared with Hydra's blood, symbolizing contemporary fears associated with contaminants and unseen toxins.

        <h2>g. Pathology - Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        Hercules' agonized expression and contorted body exemplify acute suffering, reflective of symptoms such as severe pain and distress. This visual representation underlines art’s ability to convey complex health conditions, making visceral the experience of illness.

        <h2>h. Treatment</h2>
        Within the mythological narrative, Hercules' death is inevitable, symbolically releasing him from earthly suffering. Historically, such tales often emphasized the futility of human resistance against divine or natural forces, an allegory for the limitations of contemporary medicine.

        <h2>i. Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Hercules' tragic end invites reflection on fate and circumstance affecting health. The garment given by Deianira was intended as a preventive charm, highlighting how societal beliefs and decisions impact health outcomes, even with adverse effects.
