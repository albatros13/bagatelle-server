        <h1>The Sick Child by Edvard Munch</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Edvard Munch, born in 1863, was a Norwegian painter and printmaker whose work is often recognized for its emotional depth and psychological themes. Munch’s influence on the German Expressionist movement and his impact on modern art is profound, as he managed to convey complex human emotions through his evocative style.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 1894, “The Sick Child” depicts a scene from Munch’s childhood when his sister, Sophie, was suffering from tuberculosis. This period in Europe saw high mortality rates due to infectious diseases, especially tuberculosis, which was rampant due to poor living conditions and limited medical knowledge.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The etching portrays the themes of illness and death, common in Munch’s works. The child lying in bed symbolizes innocence and suffering, while the adult figure—often interpreted as a grieving parent—represents sorrow and helplessness. The somber tones and blurred lines emphasize the emotional distance and impending loss.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Munch’s use of dark, moody colors and expressive, loose lines characterizes his distinctive style. In “The Sick Child,” the contrasting elements of light and dark, and the texture created through etching techniques, draw attention to the emotional crux of the scene. This style later influenced the Symbolist and Expressionist movements.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The artwork reflects the social inequities of the time, particularly how poverty and inadequate healthcare contributed to the spread of tuberculosis. This disease disproportionately affected the lower socioeconomic classes, highlighting the societal need for improved living conditions and medical care.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs, though it can spread to other organs. The bacterium is transmitted through airborne particles, which makes it highly contagious, especially in crowded and poorly ventilated spaces.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Common signs of tuberculosis include a persistent cough, chest pain, fatigue, fever, and weight loss. In the artwork, the child’s pallor and the somber atmosphere signify the debilitating nature of the disease, as well as the emotional toll on both the patient and their family.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Munch’s era, tuberculosis had limited treatment options. Patients were often sent to sanatoriums where they could rest and receive fresh air—a practice rooted in the belief that rest and a healthy climate were beneficial. Modern treatment includes a course of antibiotics over several months.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and overpopulation significantly contributed to the prevalence of tuberculosis. Without access to proper healthcare and knowledge, many individuals suffering from the disease lacked the means for adequate treatment and prevention.</p>
