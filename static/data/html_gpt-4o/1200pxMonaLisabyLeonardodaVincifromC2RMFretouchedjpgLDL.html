        <h1>Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        Leonardo da Vinci, one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance, painted the Mona Lisa. Born in 1452 in Vinci, Italy, he was a polymath whose expertise spanned various fields including painting, anatomy, and engineering. Da Vinci's ability to integrate art and science was unique. His painting, the Mona Lisa, has been lauded for its artistry and mystery.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        Painted between 1503 and 1506, the Mona Lisa emerges from the Italian Renaissance, a period of renewed interest in classical philosophy, art, and science. The era was marked by a shift from medieval to more humanistic values, emphasizing the potential of man. Florence, where Leonardo spent much of his career, was a hub of artistic and intellectual activity.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        The Mona Lisa is renowned for its enigmatic expression, often described as a smile. The delicately painted background merges into the figure subtly, employing sfumato to enhance the mysterious atmosphere. The landscape is thought to represent harmony with nature—a common Renaissance theme. Her gaze follows viewers around the room, engaging them directly.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        Da Vinci's use of sfumato—a technique of blending colors and tones—creates soft transitions between light and shadow, giving the painting its lifelike quality. The use of perspective and proportion exemplifies Renaissance ideals. The balanced composition, with Lisa seated centrally, provides a sense of calm and order.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        While da Vinci’s works epitomized the pinnacle of cultural achievement, the Renaissance era was marked by stark social hierarchies. Art was often commissioned by the wealthy, leaving marginalized voices out of the narrative. Women, despite being occasionally depicted in art, had restricted roles and limited recognition in the artistic sphere.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        Over the years, various scholars have speculated about health conditions depicted in the Mona Lisa. Some suggest the painting portrays a woman with hypothyroidism—the result of an underactive thyroid gland, manifesting as puffiness in the skin and a drooping eyelid.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        The slight puffiness around the neck and subtle yellowing of her skin have been suggested as indicators of thyroid dysfunction. Additionally, her enigmatic smile and gaze have prompted discussions about neurological disorders that could affect facial muscles and expressions.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        In the Renaissance period, medical understanding was limited, and treatments for thyroid-related conditions were rudimentary. Remedies might have included a mix of herbal concoctions, dietary adjustments, or superstitious practices, as scientific medicine was in its infancy.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Access to healthcare was highly dependent on social status during the Renaissance. The wealthy could afford better care and treatments, while common people had limited options. Nutrition, living conditions, and stress levels, heavily influenced by social standing, would greatly affect one’s health and susceptibility to diseases like hypothyroidism.
