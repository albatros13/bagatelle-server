        <h1>La virgen de la leche</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>La virgen de la leche was painted by Maestro Bartolome in 1490. Although little is known about Maestro Bartolome, his work is often associated with the stylistic and compositional norms of late 15th-century Spanish painting. His contributions reside within the broader framework of Gothic art, a transitional period that moved toward the more naturalistic approaches characterizing the Renaissance.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The painting was created during a time of great transition in Spain and Europe as a whole. The late 15th century was marked by religious zeal, changes in cultural practices, and the beginning of the Renaissance. The Catholic Church significantly influenced art, making religious depictions prevalent. Spain also experienced political shifts under monarchs like Ferdinand and Isabella, impacting cultural and artistic expressions.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>This painting is emblematic of Marian iconography, focusing on the nurturing aspect of the Virgin Mary. Known as the "Virgin of Milk" or "Nursing Madonna," the image highlights motherhood, purity, and divine providence. The infant Jesus symbolizes the Savior, while Mary's act of breastfeeding serves as a metaphor for spiritual nourishment.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The painting employs a Gothic style with a transition toward more realistic representation. The composition emphasizes balance and symmetry. The delicate rendering of fabric and skin tones reflects a keen attention to detail. The use of gold leaf in the background provides a celestial, otherworldly aura, elevating the divine nature of the subjects.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>While religious themes were widely celebrated, the painting highlights social hierarchies ingrained in European societies. Art was largely patronized and consumed by the elite, making access to such spiritual imagery limited to upper classes and religious institutions. This element underscores the inequities present in cultural production and reception.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Although the painting itself does not explicitly describe a disease, it can be seen as a reference to maternal and infant health. The act of breastfeeding addresses issues related to nutrition and infant mortality, key concerns in medieval Europe, where medical understandings were limited and influenced by folk practices.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In historical context, breastfeeding was closely linked to health. Absence of it often led to malnutrition and higher infant mortality rates. While the painting idealizes the act, it can be particularly poignant regarding neonatal care, which depended significantly on maternal well-being and access to resources.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Medical treatments in the late 15th century were primitive. For maternal and infant health, practices included herbal remedies, wet nursing, and dietary adjustments. Breastfeeding itself was considered a crucial practice for infant survival, reinforcing the painting's depiction of maternal care as vital for health.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and geographic location heavily influenced maternal and child health in the 15th century. Wealthier classes had better access to nutrition and medical attention, while poorer segments faced higher disease burdens, underscoring prevailing inequities.</p>
