        <h1>Peltier Third French Lancers - Sir Charles Bell</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        Sir Charles Bell was a renowned Scottish surgeon, anatomist, and artist. His contributions to the field of anatomy are invaluable, particularly through his detailed illustrations. Bell is credited with pioneering research in neuroanatomy, especially in defining the structure and function of nerves.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        This artwork was created in 1836, during a period marked by significant advances in medical science and anatomy. The early 19th century was a time when medical professionals were beginning to investigate the correlations between anatomy and pathology more deeply. The artistic context of this period was heavily influenced by Romanticism, emphasizing emotion, and a deep appreciation of nature and human anatomy.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        The artwork depicts a wounded soldier, embodying both the valor and vulnerability of war, typical of the Romantic era's fascination with heroic suffering and pathos. The exposed wound with its disturbing realism serves as a direct symbol of the horrors of war and the fragility of the human body under duress.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        Bell’s use of color and form focuses heavily on realism to convey a scientific narrative. The detailed rendering of textures and anatomy illustrates Bell's dual roles as a surgeon and an artist. The composition directs the viewer’s gaze to the prominent wound, capturing both the viewer's curiosity and empathy.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        The work highlights social inequities, notably the harsh realities faced by soldiers. Their injuries and the subsequent lack of adequate medical care reflect broader societal issues, such as class disparity, which often dictated who received proper treatment.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        The painting depicts a suppurating wound on the soldier's abdomen, likely a result of a penetrating trauma common in combat scenarios. During this epoch, bacterial infections were rampant due to limited medical knowledge about sterilization and hygiene in battlefield conditions.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        Visible within the artwork is a large, inflamed mass, suggesting an abscess or severe infection. The discoloration and apparent tenderness of the area indicate inflammation as part of the body’s immune response to infection.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        In the early 19th century, battlefield wounds were treated with rudimentary surgical interventions, often involving amputation or draining of abscesses. The absence of antibiotics meant that infections could progress rapidly, often proving fatal if not properly managed.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Social determinants such as the living conditions of soldiers, lack of medical advancements, and the prevailing war climate significantly impacted the health outcomes. Poor sanitation and nutrition exacerbated susceptibility to infections among soldiers during this period.
