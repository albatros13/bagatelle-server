        <h1>Art Historical and Medical Analysis of "Charity" from Seven Works of Mercy by Santi Buglioni</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        Santi Buglioni (1494–1576) was a noted Italian sculptor and ceramist from Florence. Part of the Buglioni family, known for their terracotta works, Santi contributed significantly to Renaissance art through his detailed sculptures and reliefs.

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        The "Seven Works of Mercy" were crafted around 1525 during the High Renaissance, a period that saw an explosion of artistic talent and the development of new styles. During this time, art became a means to communicate religious and moral lessons, often commissioned by the Church or wealthy patrons.

        <h2>Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        In "Charity," various figures are engaged in acts of mercy. The religious symbolism reflects Christian values of kindness and compassion, essential themes in Renaissance art. Iconographic elements like halos signify divine connection or saintly individuals.

        <h2>Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        Buglioni's work is marked by its realistic portrayal of figures and narrative clarity. The use of color in glazed terracotta adds lifelike vibrancy, while the balanced composition guides the viewer's eye across the scene. Attention to detail, particularly in facial expressions and drapery, exemplifies Renaissance ideals of beauty and proportion.

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        The work reflects the social stratification of the time, with charitable deeds often performed by or in the presence of the religious elite. The art served as moral instruction for society, emphasizing charity as a social obligation, potentially highlighting disparities in wealth and power.

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        Within the context of "Charity," disease is represented metaphorically through the acts of mercy, such as caring for the sick. Though specific diseases are not depicted, the general care for the needy reflects societal concerns about health and morality in the Renaissance era.

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        Representations of illness in art often include visible signs such as pallor or lesions, symbolizing the need for care. In this relief, physical ailments signify broader human conditions, fostering empathy and community support.

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        Treatment during the Renaissance primarily relied on traditional medical practices, including herbal remedies and religious interventions. The portrayal of caregiving in the relief underscores the importance of community help and spiritual guidance in healing.

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Factors such as poverty, access to care, and religious influence played significant roles in health outcomes. Arts like Buglioni’s provided awareness and education on caring for the less fortunate, reflecting a society grappling with these issues.
