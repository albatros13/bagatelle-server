        <h1>Art and Health Analysis of Dick Ket</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Dick Ket was a notable Dutch painter known for his precise and detailed still lifes and portraits. His work often reflected his own life experiences and the challenges he faced with his health.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>Ket's work emerged during the interwar period, a time marked by significant socio-economic and political upheaval in Europe. The art of this period often reflects a tension between traditional forms and modernist experimentation.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The symbolism in Ket's work often includes themes of isolation and introspection. Objects in his paintings, such as flowers and everyday items, carry symbolic weight and reflect his contemplations on life and mortality.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Ket's style is characterized by meticulous detail, clarity, and a heightened realism. His use of composition and light emphasizes the emotional depth and complex layers of his subjects.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The period in which Ket worked saw immense disruption due to war and economic struggles, impacting access to resources such as healthcare, which affected artists and entire communities marginalized by the socio-political climate.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Dick Ket suffered from a congenital heart defect which profoundly influenced his life and work. This condition limited his physical capabilities and was a persistent underlying theme in his art.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Ket's works often display physical signs of his condition, such as the portrayal of thinness and frailty. These features serve as poignant reminders of his personal battle with illness.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Ket's lifetime, medical treatments for heart conditions were limited and largely experimental. He relied on restricted physical activity and careful self-monitoring to manage his condition.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The economic and social constraints of the time exacerbated Ket's health challenges. Limited access to advanced medical interventions and support systems were significant factors in his experience of illness.</p>
