        <h1>Theodore Gericault's Portrait of a Man Suffering from Delusions of Military Command (1822)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        <p>The painting "Portrait of a Man Suffering from Delusions of Military Command" was created by French artist Théodore Géricault. Renowned for his dramatic and expressive style, Géricault was a pivotal figure in the Romantic movement, which emphasized emotion and individualism. His works often explored themes of madness, human suffering, and the complexities of the human condition.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted in 1822, this artwork emerges during a period of significant socio-political upheaval in post-revolutionary France. The early 19th century was marked by Napoleon's rise and fall, the Bourbon Restoration, and evolving perspectives on mental illness. Géricault's work reflects this era's fascination with psychological states and the human psyche.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The man's military attire symbolizes authority, power, and the delusions he harbored. His attire, however, is worn and neglected, possibly indicating the dichotomy between his perceived status and his mental condition. Géricault uses these elements to capture the tension between reality and the individual’s delusions, representing broader themes of identity and societal roles.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Géricault's use of chiaroscuro creates a stark contrast between light and dark areas, highlighting the man’s intense expression. The muted color palette emphasizes the somber and introspective nature of the subject. The lack of a detailed background focuses the viewer's attention on the subject's psychological state.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>At the time, mental illness was poorly understood and stigmatized. Many individuals suffering from psychological disorders faced social marginalization and were often institutionalized. Géricault’s portrayal can be seen as a critique of contemporary attitudes towards mental health, and a plea for compassion and understanding.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The subject appears to suffer from delusions of grandeur, a condition where an individual believes they have much greater power or influence than is actually the case. These delusions are often symptomatic of mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The man's distant gaze and somber demeanor suggest a disconnect from reality, characteristic of delusional disorders. His attire and expression may hint at episodes of mania followed by depression, common in bipolar disorder.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Géricault's time, treatments for mental illness included confinement in asylums, often without effective therapies. Today, such conditions are managed through psychotherapy, medication, and support networks, though access and quality of treatment vary globally.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors contributing to mental illness include socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and social trauma. In the 19th century, these were compounded by a lack of medical knowledge and widespread societal stigma. Today, efforts continue to address these determinants to improve mental health outcomes.</p>
