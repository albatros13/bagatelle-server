        <h1>Art Historical and Medical Analysis of Judith and Holofernes</h1>
        
        <h2>a) Artist</h2>
        <p>The painting titled "Judith and Holofernes" was created by Artemisia Gentileschi, a prominent Baroque artist known for her powerful depictions of biblical heroines. Born in Rome in 1593, Gentileschi was one of the few female artists to achieve success and recognition in the male-dominated art world of the 17th century.</p>
        
        <h2>b) Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>This artwork was painted in the early 17th century, a time marked by dramatic social, religious, and political changes in Europe. The Baroque era, characterized by its emotional intensity and dramatic use of light and shadow, was flourishing, and Gentileschi was influenced by Caravaggio, a key figure in this movement.</p>
        
        <h2>c) Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>Gentileschi's depiction of Judith, a biblical heroine who saved her people by beheading the Assyrian general Holofernes, symbolizes female strength and courage. The painting’s dark palette and intense expressions convey the gravity and violence of the scene. The inclusion of Holofernes' head in the basket speaks to themes of justice and retribution.</p>
        
        <h2>d) Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Gentileschi employed Caravaggio's technique of tenebrism, where stark contrasts between light and dark are utilized to create dramatic effects. The detailed rendering of textures in the fabrics and the lifelike portrayal of human figures demonstrate her mastery of both realism and emotional expression.</p>
        
        <h2>e) Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Gentileschi's life was fraught with challenges as a female artist in a patriarchal society. Her works often reflect her personal experiences of injustice, particularly in light of her own traumatic history. Her portrayal of strong, resilient women can be seen as both autobiographical and a broader commentary on gender dynamics of her era.</p>
        
        <h2>f) Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The painting draws attention to a visible goiter on one of the figures. A goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland, which can be caused by iodine deficiency, autoimmune diseases, or other thyroid disorders. During the Baroque period, goiters were relatively common in Europe due to dietary deficiencies.</p>
        
        <h2>g) Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the artwork, the presence of a goiter can be identified as a swelling at the base of the neck. Such swellings were common signifiers of thyroid dysfunctions in historical medical writings and can indicate serious underlying health issues, including hormone imbalances and metabolic problems.</p>
        
        <h2>h) Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the time this artwork was created, treatments for goiters included folk remedies and surgical interventions. Iodine-rich foods were sometimes administered to alleviate symptoms, although the understanding of thyroid-related illnesses was limited.</p>
        
        <h2>i) Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Socioeconomic status and access to nutrition significantly influenced the prevalence of diseases like goiter in the 17th century. Poorer populations, often unable to access foods rich in iodine, were more susceptible. Additionally, medical resources and knowledge were primarily accessible to the wealthy, compounding health disparities.</p>
