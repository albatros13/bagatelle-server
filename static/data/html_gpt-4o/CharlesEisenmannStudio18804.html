        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The photograph was taken by Charles Eisenmann, a notable 19th-century photographer known for his depiction of individuals with physical anomalies, often referred to as "sideshow performers" or "freaks" at the time. Eisenmann operated a studio in New York City during the late 1800s, capturing images that straddled the line between curiosity and exploitation.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>In the late 19th century, sideshow attractions were a popular form of entertainment. These shows often included individuals with unique physical conditions, drawing public interest and controversially raising questions about the ethics of spectacle. This period was also marked by significant strides in medical science, although public understanding and empathy regarding congenital disorders were limited.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The clothing of the individuals in the photograph, displaying a symbol later associated with controversial ideologies, likely served a different socio-cultural message at the time. Contextually, the symbol predates the political connotations of the 20th century and potentially symbolizes good fortune or peace, which was its original meaning in many ancient cultures.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Eisenmann’s photograph employs the plain backdrop typical of studio photography of the time, emphasizing the subjects without distraction. The central positioning of the subjects suggests a sense of importance and directs viewer focus intently on the human element of the image, facilitating both personal exposure and public spectacle.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This photograph highlights the exploitation and marginalization of individuals with congenital differences. The individuals depicted were part of a community that often faced social and economic disadvantages, driven by societal fascination rather than understanding, compassion, or acceptance.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The photograph features individuals likely presenting with microcephaly, a neurological condition wherein a person’s head is significantly smaller than normal due to abnormal brain development. The condition results from various genetic and environmental factors, including infections during pregnancy or mutations.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Microcephaly is characterized by a reduced head circumference and can lead to developmental challenges and neurological deficiencies. The appearance can also include facial feature disproportion and may coincide with intellectual disabilities and motor skill impairment.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Historically, treatment options for microcephaly were extremely limited, focusing largely on supportive care to manage symptoms rather than address the root condition. Modern interventions include therapies to improve developmental outcomes, although no cure currently exists.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The societal view and treatment of individuals with visible differences were significantly shaped by prejudice, lack of medical knowledge, and cultural fascination with the unusual. These determinants fundamentally impacted livelihood and social inclusion, making them subjects of public spectacle.</p>
