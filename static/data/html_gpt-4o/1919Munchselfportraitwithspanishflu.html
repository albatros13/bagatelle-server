        <h1>Munch Self Portrait with Spanish Flu (1919)</h1>
        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe:</strong></p>
        <p>Edvard Munch, a prominent Norwegian painter, is known for his expressionist works that capture psychological themes. Munch’s style often portrayed intense emotions, using vivid colors and dynamic compositions.</p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame):</strong></p>
        <p>This artwork was created in 1919, during the aftermath of the First World War and amidst the global Spanish flu pandemic. This period marked profound social and economic upheaval, influencing Munch’s work and perspective.</p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography:</strong></p>
        <p>The painting is particularly symbolic of isolation and the struggle of illness. The somber tones highlight a feeling of vulnerability and mortality, a reflection of the widespread fear and the personal impact of the flu pandemic.</p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design):</strong></p>
        <p>Munch employs a loose, expressive brushwork technique, using contrast and color to evoke emotion. The swirling background complements the isolation in the figure’s eyes, reinforcing the psychological depth typical of his oeuvre.</p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities:</strong></p>
        <p>The Spanish flu disproportionately affected different social classes, exposing inequities in healthcare access. Munch’s own encounter with the flu is reflective of broader societal vulnerabilities. The painting serves as a visual narrative of these inequities.</p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology:</strong></p>
        <p>The Spanish flu was caused by the H1N1 influenza virus, spreading rapidly across global populations. Symptoms included high fever, sore throat, and acute respiratory distress, with a high mortality rate.</p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness:</strong></p>
        <p>This artwork visually signifies illness through pallor and the introspective pose of the subject, embodying the fatigue and despair associated with the flu. The abstracted form and color palette further emphasize the theme of ailment.</p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment:</strong></p>
        <p>During the pandemic, treatment options were limited, relying on bed rest and isolation. The lack of vaccines or specific antiviral drugs made management challenging, often resulting in high mortality.</p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness:</strong></p>
        <p>Overcrowded living conditions, poor sanitation, and limited medical resources exacerbated the spread of the flu in 1919. Social hierarchies influenced access to care, disproportionately affecting lower socio-economic groups.</p>
