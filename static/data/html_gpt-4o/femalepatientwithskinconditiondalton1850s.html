        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis of "Female Patient with Skin Condition"</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        The artwork is attributed to Dalton, a historical figure active in the 1850s. While specific biographical details about Dalton are scarce, the piece reflects a meticulous approach to documenting medical conditions, a common practice among 19th-century medical illustrators.

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        The 1850s was a period marked by significant advancements in medical science, amidst the backdrop of the Industrial Revolution. The practice of documenting medical conditions through art was crucial for education, predating modern photography. This era witnessed the expansion of medical knowledge and the professionalization of the field.

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        The image uses stark realism to present a medical condition, devoid of romanticism or abstraction. The focus on the patient’s face may symbolize the humanity behind the clinical observations and serves as an educational tool, emphasizing the need for individual care and understanding in treatment.

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        Dalton's work displays a keen attention to detail, utilizing delicate lines and shading to emphasize texture and form. The composition draws the viewer’s focus directly to the afflicted areas, with subtle color variations highlighting the contrast between healthy and diseased skin.

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        During the 1850s, medical treatment was often a privilege, largely inaccessible to lower socioeconomic classes. With limited health literacy and access to healthcare, depictions like this served the dual purpose of advancing medical knowledge and highlighting the disparities in health care access and quality.

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        The skin condition depicted appears to be a severe dermatological disease, possibly smallpox or a similar infectious condition. In the 19th century, infectious diseases were prevalent due to poor sanitation and lack of vaccines, exacerbating their spread.

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        Visible signs include prominent lesions and pustules covering the patient's facial region. Such symptoms are indicative of systemic viral infection, reflecting the body's inflammatory response to pathogens, which aligns with descriptions of conditions like smallpox.

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        In the 1850s, treatments for skin conditions were primitive by today’s standards, often involving herbal concoctions, bleedings, and rudimentary sanitation improvements. It wasn’t until later in the century that vaccines and antiseptic techniques began to significantly change therapeutic approaches.

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        Factors such as poverty, lack of hygiene, and crowded living conditions greatly influenced the prevalence and spread of infectious diseases during this era. The limited availability of medical care further compounded the risks for those in disadvantaged communities.
