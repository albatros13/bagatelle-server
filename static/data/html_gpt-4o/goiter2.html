        <h2>Art Historical and Medical Analysis of Goiter (2)</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>
            The artwork in discussion is an artifact from a Mesoamerican culture, possibly crafted by the ancient Mayans. The Mayans were known for their rich mythology, advanced architectural feats, and elaborate artworks in pottery and sculpture. The precise artist of this piece remains unidentified, placing focus on the collective artistry of the community.
        </p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h3>
        <p>
            This sculpture is from the pre-Columbian era, likely crafted between 250 AD and 900 AD, during the Classic period of Mayan civilization. This era was marked by significant advancements in architecture, art, and intellectual achievements within the Mayan society. 
        </p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>
            The prominent feature of the swollen neck on the figure is indicative of goiter, which may symbolize a reflection on health, fertility, or divine affliction. This physical abnormality was possibly used to convey messages or stories related to the societal beliefs about health and the divine.
        </p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>
            The statue employs exaggerated features—particularly in the face and neck—to capture attention and convey symbolic meaning. The use of ear piercings and headgear reflects the cultural emphasis on ceremonial attire and status. The material likely clay or stone, is typical of the era, emphasizing longevity.
        </p>

        <h3>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>
            While Mayan society had an intricate class system, access to health treatment and recognition of diseases like goiter varied greatly among classes. Physical afflictions might have had diverse implications depending on socio-cultural context, particularly differentiating between ordinary citizens and elite figures.
        </p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>
            Goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland, primarily due to iodine deficiency. In historical contexts without modern understanding of nutrition, this condition was common in areas away from coastal regions where iodine-rich diets were less prevalent.
        </p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>
            The notable swelling around the neck is the hallmark of goiter representation. It would have been a visible and acknowledged condition within the community, possibly interpreted with superstitious or religious undertones.
        </p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>
            Treatment in ancient times was rudimentary, comprising herbal remedies or ritualistic practices. It was not until much later that iodine supplements became understood as a preventative measure. Treatments could have been more ceremonial, aimed at alleviating the perceived spiritual causes.
        </p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>
            The prevalence of goiter would have been influenced by geographical factors, such as remoteness from iodine-rich shorelines. Social class also played a role; higher classes may have had slightly better access to diverse foods but were not immune to nutritional deficiencies.
