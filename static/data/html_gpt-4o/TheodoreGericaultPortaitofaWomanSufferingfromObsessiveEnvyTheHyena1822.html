        <h1>Theodore Gericault - Portrait of a Woman Suffering from Obsessive Envy</h1>
        <h2>a. Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artist behind this compelling work is Théodore Géricault, a prominent figure in the Romantic movement in France. Known for his dramatic and detailed approach, Géricault often explored the darker sides of the human condition in his art. His keen attention to human physiognomy and psychological states is evident in his "Portrait of a Woman Suffering from Obsessive Envy."</p>

        <h2>b. Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted in 1822, this artwork emerges from a period in post-revolutionary France characterized by a burgeoning interest in human psychology and the complexities of mental health. The early 19th century saw a societal shift towards understanding mental illnesses more scientifically, marking a departure from demonizing such conditions.</p>

        <h2>c. Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting's somber tones and the woman's pensive expression highlight Géricault's intent to delve into the psyche of his subjects. Her demeanor, coupled with the stark play of light and shadow, symbolize the inner turmoil associated with envy, a condition often rooted in profound dissatisfaction and insecurity.</p>

        <h2>d. Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Géricault's use of chiaroscuro enhances the dramatic tension within the piece. The contrast between light and dark not only defines the woman's facial features but also serves to underscore her emotional state. This technique, along with Géricault’s meticulous brushwork, adds depth and intensity to the portrait, bringing the subject's emotional plight to the forefront.</p>

        <h2>e. Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The period in which this work was created was rife with inequality, and mental illness was often misunderstood. People suffering from mental conditions were marginalized and stigmatized, lacking the support systems available today. Through his art, Géricault sought to humanize these individuals, bringing awareness to their struggles.</p>

        <h2>f. Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The condition depicted, referred to as "Obsessive Envy," is considered a profound pathological jealousy that interferes with an individual’s daily life. It can prompt harmful behaviors and is often rooted in underlying psychological issues such as insecurity, inferiority, or narcissism.</p>

        <h2>g. Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the portrait, the woman’s facial expression manifests characteristics of obsessive envy: a furrowed brow, tightly pressed lips, and eyes that seem to dart with unease. These features serve as visible signifiers of inner turmoil and obsessive fixation.</p>

        <h2>h. Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Géricault's time, treatment for mental illness was rudimentary and often inhumane. With limited understanding, most individuals were subjected to confinement and harsh methods. Today, however, therapies for treating conditions similar to “obsessive envy” include psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral approaches, and sometimes medication that targets specific symptoms.</p>

        <h2>i. Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Envy as a psychological condition can be exacerbated by social determinants such as economic disparity, lack of access to mental health care, and social isolation. These factors can deepen feelings of inadequacy and intensify obsessive thoughts.</p>
