        <h1>Robert Hannah: William Harvey Demonstrating to Charles I His Theory of the Circulation of the Blood, 1848</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Robert Hannah, a 19th-century British artist, created the painting “William Harvey Demonstrating to Charles I His Theory of the Circulation of the Blood” in 1848. Known for his historical and genre works, Hannah often focused on moments of scientific and intellectual revelation. This artwork embodies Hannah’s interest in capturing the pivotal breakthroughs of history within a narrative context.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted in the mid-19th century, Hannah's work reflects the Victorian era’s fascination with scientific progress during a period marked by the Industrial Revolution. The subject matter refers back to the early 17th century, the time of King Charles I's reign in England, when significant advancements in scientific thought and exploration began shaping modern science.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting captures a meeting between William Harvey, a pioneering anatomist, and King Charles I. The presence of a royal figure next to a scientist symbolizes the merger of power and knowledge during a time of burgeoning scientific inquiry. The positioning and expressions of the figures portray respect and attentiveness to the life-altering discovery being demonstrated.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Stylistically, Hannah employs a naturalistic palette and realistic detailing that draw the viewer into the narrative. The chiaroscuro technique, with its interplay of light and shadow, emphasizes the central figures, highlighting the dramatic significance of the scientific discovery. The composition directs focus towards Harvey, who is set against a darkened background, illuminating his role as the bearer of enlightenment.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The work reflects social hierarchies of the time, showcasing the dominance of male intellectuals in scientific narratives. There's an overt absence of women and lower-class individuals, indicating the exclusionary practices within the realms of science and governance during both the 17th and 19th centuries.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While the painting does not depict a disease per se, it illustrates Harvey’s theory of blood circulation, a groundbreaking understanding that redefined medical approaches. This discovery debunked earlier theories and provided insight into cardiovascular functions critical for diagnosing and treating heart-related illnesses.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the context of Harvey’s theory, the central pathology discussed involves abnormalities in blood circulation, which can signify diseases such as heart failure, hypertension, or embolisms. Observing the pulse and veins would become essential in identifying these issues.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Following Harvey’s discovery, treatments began focusing on restoring proper circulation and supporting cardiac health. Methods evolved from rudimentary practices to more scientifically founded approaches, incorporating dietary, medicinal, and eventually surgical interventions.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Access to treatment following advancements in medical science was heavily influenced by social status. The elite had better access to emerging medical practices, while lower socioeconomic groups were less likely to benefit immediately from such discoveries, owing to economic and informational barriers.</p>
