        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
            <p>The artwork depicted is attributed to Hieronymus Brunschwig, a notable German surgeon and medical author of the early 16th century. Known for his significant contributions to the field of surgery, Brunschwig's works were pivotal in disseminating surgical knowledge during his time.</p>

            <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
            <p>Produced in the early 1500s, this image comes from a time when Europe was undergoing significant changes brought about by the Renaissance. During this period, there was a burgeoning interest in science, anatomy, and the human body, influenced by an increasing focus on observational study and empirical method often inspired by earlier classical texts and Islamic medical knowledge.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
            <p>The illustration emphasizes the human form, often shown with layers peeled back to reveal the internal organs. This focus underscores the Renaissance interest in anatomy and the human body as a microcosm of the universe, symbolizing the quest for knowledge and understanding of human biology from a scientific perspective.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
            <p>Stylistically, this image adopts the woodcut technique, which was common in the period for producing medical texts. The composition is characterized by clear black lines defining anatomical features, providing both artistic and educational value. The use of space and proportion conveys a balance between biological detail and simplistic illustration suitable for educational dissemination.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
            <p>In historical contexts such as this one, access to medical knowledge was limited, predominantly available to educated male professionals. Such texts, although revolutionary, were rarely disseminated among women or the lower socio-economic classes, reflecting the inequities of educational access at the time.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
            <p>The artwork likely illustrates various anatomical scenarios, potentially exploring injuries or ailments relevant to surgical intervention. Common conditions explored during this period included trauma from warfare, infections, and maladies that affected the stomach and limbs, considering their frequent depiction in surgical manuals.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
            <p>The image may depict pathological signs through the exposure of body parts susceptible to illness or injury. Emblematic cuts or labels often accompany these illustrations, indicating areas of interest or common afflictions, such as swellings, fractures, or abscesses, to guide surgical practice.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
            <p>Treatment methods reflected in such artworks usually involved rudimentary surgical techniques, often derived from classical sources. Bloodletting, cauterization, and rudimentary forms of antiseptic were common practices shown in these surgical guides to address various medical issues.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
            <p>Socio-economic and environmental factors significant to this era included living conditions, diet, and occupational hazards—often cited in medieval medical texts as contributing to health issues. Proximity to pollutants and limited access to hygiene were also prevalent determinants in the onset of diseases.</p>
