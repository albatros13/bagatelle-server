        <h2>A Vergers Dream Saints Cosmas and Damian Performing a Miraculous Cure by Transplantation of a Leg - Attributed to the Master of Los Balbases (1495)</h2>

        <h3>Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>This artwork is attributed to the Master of Los Balbases, an anonymous Spanish painter active during the late 15th century. The Master of Los Balbases is known for his religious works, often characterized by detailed and vivid depictions of biblical stories and saints.</p>

        <h3>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h3>
        <p>Created in 1495, the painting belongs to the late Gothic period, a time when religious art flourished in Spain. The era was marked by a transition from medieval to Renaissance values, but many aspects of medieval spirituality and iconography remained deeply rooted in art.</p>

        <h3>Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The painting depicts the miraculous transplantation of a leg by Saints Cosmas and Damian, who were twin brothers and physicians martyred in the early Christian era. They are celebrated for their miraculous healing abilities, often symbolizing divine intervention in medicine.</p>

        <h3>Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>The use of vivid colors, intricate patterns, and a layered composition is characteristic of Gothic art. The detailed rendering of fabrics, the linear perspective, and the spatial arrangement reflect the artistic transition towards more naturalistic depictions of depth and volume.</p>

        <h3>Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>This artwork can be viewed in the context of historical inequities, where access to healing and medicine was largely influenced by social status. The miraculous nature of the saints’ interventions underscores the limitations of contemporary medicine and the reliance on divine power for healing.</p>

        <h3>Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The painting is not focused on a specific disease, but it illustrates a miraculous surgical procedure — the transplantation of a limb. This allegorical depiction resonates more with narratives of divine intervention than with true medical practice, which at the time struggled with limited anatomical knowledge and infectious consequences.</p>

        <h3>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The imagery of the severed leg awaiting transplantation symbolizes the period’s rudimentary understanding of pathology and the drastic measures, often supernatural, believed necessary to treat severe bodily ailments.</p>

        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>In the artwork, treatment is depicted as miraculous intervention. During the time, actual medical treatments were limited, focusing largely on balancing bodily humors or resorting to religious rites for healing.</p>

        <h3>Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Social determinants, such as poverty and lack of access to medical care, heavily influenced health outcomes. Miraculous tales served both a spiritual purpose and an explanation for diseases' inexplicable nature and recovery in impoverished communities.</p>
