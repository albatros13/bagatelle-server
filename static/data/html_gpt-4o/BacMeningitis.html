        <h2>Bac Meningitis</h2>
        <h3>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>This artwork is attributed to Francisco Goya, a prominent figure in Spanish art, renowned for his profound influence on both the Romantic and modern art movements. His work often engaged deeply with human suffering and social issues, which is evident in this particular painting.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>Created in the early 19th century, this piece is situated within the turbulent socio-political climate of Spain. The Peninsular War and the Napoleonic invasion had left Spain in turmoil, affecting its society and culture. Goya’s work reflects the introspective and critical outlook of this period.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The painting uses dark tones and stark contrasts to symbolize the gravity of illness and human fragility. The presence of a caregiver suggests themes of empathy and the societal roles in caring for the ill. The subdued color palette underscores the solemnity associated with disease and suffering.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>Goya’s use of chiaroscuro highlights the central figures against a dim background, directing the viewer’s focus to the interaction between the ailment and the caretaker. The emotional depth is accentuated by the expressive brushwork and the realistic representation, hallmarks of Goya's mature style.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The artwork subtly critiques the disparity in access to healthcare. The depiction of illness in art serves to highlight the struggles faced by those in lower socio-economic classes, who often had limited access to medical assistance. This theme is recurrent in Goya’s work, pointing to the inequities experienced during his lifetime.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known as the meninges. It is typically caused by various bacterial pathogens, with <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> being the most common culprits. Transmission is often through respiratory droplets.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The signs of bacterial meningitis include severe headache, neck stiffness, fever, confusion, and sensitivity to light. These symptoms develop rapidly and require immediate medical attention. The artwork captures the debilitated state of the patient, possibly signifying the acute nature of the disease.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment for bacterial meningitis typically involves prompt administration of intravenous antibiotics and, in some cases, corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent complications and improve outcomes.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Social factors, such as crowded living conditions and lack of access to healthcare, can increase susceptibility to infectious diseases like bacterial meningitis. This artwork implicitly raises awareness of these factors, reflecting broader societal challenges.</p>
