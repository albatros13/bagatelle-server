        <h1>Salvador Dali: Invisible Lion, Horse, Sleeping Woman, and Hysteria</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Salvador Dali (1904-1989), the Spanish surrealist artist, is known for his eccentric and flamboyant style. His unique approach to art has captivated audiences around the world. Dali’s work often draws on themes of the subconscious, hallucinations, and dreamlike scenarios, which reflect his fascination with psychoanalysis, particularly the work of Sigmund Freud.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This artwork was created during the early to mid-20th century, a period of immense change and turmoil, marked by the aftermath of World War I and the approach of World War II. The surrealist movement, to which Dali was a significant contributor, emerged as a reaction to the devastation of war and the search for deeper truths beyond the observable world. Artists were influenced by psychoanalysis and the exploration of the subconscious.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>Dali’s work is replete with symbols that reflect his ideas and personal obsessions. The melting figures and distorted forms in the painting symbolize the fluid nature of reality and consciousness. The lion and horse may symbolize strength and power juxtaposed with vulnerability and instability, which are highlighted through their melting forms. The sleeping woman represents hysteria, drawing on contemporary scientific and pseudo-scientific thought on mental illness.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>This work embodies surrealism through its dream-like quality and bizarre juxtapositions. Dali’s meticulous detail and use of light and shadow create a hyper-realistic effect that invites deeper introspection into the realms of the unconscious. The composition balances fluid, surreal elements with rigid, architectural forms, reflecting a tension between reality and imagination.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The era during which Dali worked was marked by gender roles and stereotypes, especially concerning mental health. Women were frequently diagnosed with hysteria, a catch-all term used to describe various forms of psychological distress. This painting comments on the social conditions that pathologized women's behavior, showcasing Dali’s interest in both challenging and expressing these inequities.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Hysteria, historically considered a female disorder, was thought to be a result of nervous disorders and often linked to the uterus. It was a psychiatric disorder characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including anxiety, fainting, and convulsions. Modern medicine largely debunks the concept, recognizing it as part of broader psychiatric conditions.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The visual distortion in the imagery represents psychological instability and imbalance. The figures' melting forms and fragmented representation signify the disintegration and loss of control experienced by those labeled as hysteric. By exaggerating these features, Dali captures the chaotic and misunderstood experience of mental illness.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In Dali’s time, treatments for hysteria were rudimentary and often invasive, including rest cures, isolation, and, in severe cases, lobotomy. Today, understanding mental health has evolved towards holistic and empathetic approaches, emphasizing therapy, medication, and support systems tailored to individual needs.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The depiction in the artwork alludes to factors contributing to mental illness, such as societal constructs and gender roles. The pressure on women to conform to societal norms often resulted in conflicts between personal identity and societal expectations, contributing to mental health issues being mislabeled as hysteria.</p>
