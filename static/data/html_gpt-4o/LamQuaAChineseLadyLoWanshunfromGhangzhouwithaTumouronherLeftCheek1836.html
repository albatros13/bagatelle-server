        <h1>Lam Qua - A Chinese Lady Lo Wanshun from Ghangzhou with a Tumor on Her Left Cheek (1836)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Lam Qua was a Chinese painter known for his portraits and medical illustrations in the early 19th century. He collaborated with Western doctors to document medical anomalies through art, serving as an intersection between art and science.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The painting was created in 1836 during the Qing Dynasty, a time when trade between China and Western nations was expanding. The socio-cultural exchange fostered by trade included art, and Lam Qua was one of the few Chinese artists to integrate Western painting techniques.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The artwork serves as a historical document capturing medical conditions and treatments via a visual medium. The tumor showcased represents not only a medical anomaly but also the challenges faced by individuals dealing with such conditions in historical contexts.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Lam Qua's style is marked by a fusion of Chinese and Western artistic techniques, particularly in the use of realistic portraiture. The attention to detail, particularly in the representation of the tumor, highlights the principles of realism and attention to human condition, which were less common in traditional Chinese art at the time.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The portrait also points to disparities in medical treatment access. At a time when many could not afford or access medical help, those who were the subjects of these artworks often relied on the charity or interest of Western medical practitioners documenting their conditions.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The painting displays a woman with a large facial tumor on her left cheek. Such tumors could be caused by a variety of conditions including benign growths like lipomas or more serious forms such as sarcomas, with unclear etiology in the 19th century.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The swelling is prominent and asymmetrical, which are key indicators of a pathological condition. The texture and volume suggest an irregular growth needing medical examination, reflecting the medical interest in documenting such anomalies.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the 19th century, treatment options for such growths were very limited. Often, traditional remedies or surgical interventions by Western doctors were the only options, albeit risky and with varying success rates.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social factors such as poverty, lack of accessibility to healthcare, and societal perception towards deformities played a significant role in the experiences of patients like the subject of this portrait. These determinants often dictated the level and kind of care patients received.</p>
