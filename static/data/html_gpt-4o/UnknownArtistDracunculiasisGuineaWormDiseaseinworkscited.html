        <h1>Dracunculiasis Guinea Worm Disease in Art</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork in question is attributed to an unknown artist. It reflects the style and methods prevalent in medieval European art, where artists often remained anonymous, or their identities were lost over time.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This artwork is likely from the medieval period, based on its stylistic elements. During this time, art served not only as religious devotion but also as documentary pieces of human ailments and practices. The context captured in this piece gives us insight into the escalation of artistic interest in depicting health conditions as part of societal narrative.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The depiction of the leg with a creeping thread-like form represents Dracunculiasis, also known as Guinea worm disease. The leg is an emblematic symbol associated with strength and mobility; thus, the affliction is illustrated to highlight the debilitating nature of the disease physically and symbolically.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork employs contrast, focusing viewer attention on the affected limb against a backdrop of traditional medieval garments and posturing. The artist's use of color and form emphasizes the dire medical condition, creating a dramatic narrative potent with tension and empathy.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>At the time, health disparities were significant, with diseases like Dracunculiasis predominantly affecting rural, impoverished communities. Such artwork not only documented the medical conditions but also underscored the societal inequities, drawing awareness to battles the less privileged faced against health adversities.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Dracunculiasis is caused by the parasitic worm Dracunculus medinensis. The larvae enter the human body through contaminated water. Once inside, they mature and migrate through the body, eventually emerging through a painful blister on the skin, often on the lower limbs.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The hallmark sign of Guinea worm disease is the emergence of a long thread-like worm from the skin. This process causes severe physical pain and discomfort. Infection can lead to secondary bacterial infections, rendering the disease particularly debilitating.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Historically, the treatment involved carefully extracting the worm by winding it around a small stick. Cleanliness and patience were requisite to manage this process over several days. Modern public health efforts focus on prevention via clean drinking water and educational initiatives.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as poverty, limited access to clean water, and inadequate health knowledge are primary determinants allowing the persistence of Dracunculiasis. Combatting these social determinants is crucial in eradication efforts.</p>
