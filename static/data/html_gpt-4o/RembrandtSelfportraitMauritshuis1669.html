        <h1>Rembrandt Self Portrait Mauritshuis (1669)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            The artwork is by Rembrandt van Rijn, one of the most celebrated Dutch painters and a master of the Baroque period. Recognized for his contributions to art with a profound understanding of human emotion and intricate use of shadow and light, Rembrandt's work remains a cornerstone of European art history. 
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            Painted in 1669, this self-portrait belongs to the Dutch Golden Age—a period marked by great wealth and cultural achievement in the Netherlands. During this era, portraits were popular among the wealthy merchant class. Rembrandt's work held significance as a document of personal expression amidst the social and economic complexities of the time.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h2>
        <p>
            In this self-portrait, the symbolism lies in the artist’s expression and pose. The visage reflects the introspective and brooding character of his later years, a stark contrast to the confident tones he used in earlier portraits. The light and shadow highlight not just the physical aspects but also the psychological depth of the artist.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            Rembrandt is credited with mastering chiaroscuro, employing it to craft dramatic intensity. The play of light and dark prominently features in this painting, drawing attention to the nuanced textures of his skin and the expressive depth of his gaze. The composition is simple yet assertive, focusing the viewer's attention on the subject without distraction.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            Despite his success, Rembrandt faced financial difficulties later in life, owing to poor investments and excessive spending. This economic contrast with his earlier success is reflective of the volatile social conditions of the time, where the gap between rich and poor widened significantly.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            The portrait may indicate signs of a disease, often speculated to be rheumatoid arthritis or cardiovascular conditions, suggested by the visible weariness and physical changes observed in his later portraits.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Specific signs like swollen joints or signs of physical wear might hint at underlying health issues. The aged appearance, loss of youthful vitality, and exaggerated features might serve as signifiers of illness or aging.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Medicine in the 17th century lacked the sophistication of modern practices. Treatments were rudimentary, often involving herbal remedies or rudimentary surgical practices, influenced by contemporary understanding which was not always based on scientific principles.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            The stresses of financial difficulty, along with the pressures of maintaining social status and personal losses, may have exacerbated Rembrandt's health issues. The environment, along with lack of access to advanced medical care, could have significantly impacted his health.
