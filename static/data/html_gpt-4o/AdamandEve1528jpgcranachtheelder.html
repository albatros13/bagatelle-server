        <h1>Adam and Eve (1528): An Art and Medical Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This artwork, "Adam and Eve," was created by Lucas Cranach the Elder, a prominent German Renaissance painter and printmaker. Known for his contributions to the development of the Lutheran Reformation and his close connections with Martin Luther, Cranach's works often reflected theological themes and biblical narratives.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 1528, "Adam and Eve" is a product of the Northern Renaissance, an era marked by religious upheaval, artistic innovation, and rediscovery of classical philosophies. This period was deeply intertwined with the Protestant Reformation, which sought to reform the Catholic Church's practices.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting depicts Adam and Eve, the biblical first man and woman, standing apart yet connected through the act of partaking the forbidden fruit. The apple held by Eve symbolizes temptation and the fall of man, while the nudity reflects innocence and the natural state before sin.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Cranach's style is noted for its attention to detail, vibrant color palette, and elongated figures. The figures’ poses are balanced and symmetrical, emphasizing harmony. His use of light and shadow accentuates the human form and gives depth to the figures against a compressed background.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>While the painting itself may not overtly confront social injustices, it reflects the broader societal contexts, such as gender roles and religious dogmas prevalent during the 16th century. The portrayal of Eve as the bearer of sin reflects long-standing narratives about female culpability in religious texts.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Theological discussions often reference 'original sin' as a spiritual disease derived from this biblical event. In a more symbolic interpretation, this sin is seen as the root cause of human suffering and moral failings, setting a precedent for human imperfections and ethical dilemmas.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The artistic representation does not directly depict pathology, but allegorically, the 'illness' of sin is indicated by the apple and the subsequent awareness of their nudity, which could symbolize the loss of innocence and the inherent human tendency towards guilt and moral struggle.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The concept of redemption and salvation as treatments to the ‘illness’ of original sin is central to Christian doctrine. Through faith, repentance, and the grace of God, individuals seek reconciliation and renewal from the spiritual ailment represented in this biblical narrative.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>In theological terms, sin is perpetuated through societal and cultural influences, including moral education, cultural narratives, and doctrinal teachings. These determinants shape individual behaviors and community values, reinforcing the perceived need for spiritual and moral rectitude.</p>
