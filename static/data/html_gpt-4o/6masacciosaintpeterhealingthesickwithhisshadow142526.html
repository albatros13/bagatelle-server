        <h1>Masaccio: Saint Peter Healing the Sick with His Shadow</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        Masaccio, born Tommaso di Ser Giovanni di Simone, was a pioneering Italian painter of the early Renaissance. Known for his innovative use of perspective and chiaroscuro, he significantly influenced the trajectory of Western art.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        Created around 1425-26, this fresco is part of the Brancacci Chapel in Florence, Italy. The early Renaissance was a period of intense artistic and scientific exploration, coinciding with societal transitions such as the growth of humanism, which placed greater emphasis on the potential of human achievements.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        The artwork depicts Saint Peter performing a miracle by healing the sick, using his shadow. The use of light and shadow symbolizes divine intervention in human affairs, portraying Peter as a conduit for God’s power.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        Masaccio was revolutionary in his application of linear perspective, allowing for realistic spatial depth. His use of chiaroscuro brings a lifelike contour to the figures, highlighting human emotion and enhancing narrative clarity.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        This artwork reflects a time when religious authority held significant sway over societal norms and healthcare disparities were vast. The dependence on divine intervention highlights a lack of accessible medical care for the impoverished.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        The figures depicted as sick may represent various contemporary ailments such as leprosy or the bubonic plague, widespread due to poor sanitation and limited medical understanding.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        Visible signs of illness such as physical deformity or weakness are realistically rendered, drawing attention to the suffering of the afflicted, emphasizing their need for miraculous healing.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        During the Renaissance, treatment options were limited and often relied on herbal remedies, primitive surgical techniques, or religious intervention. This painting underscores reliance on the latter, reflecting spiritual over scientific approaches.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Factors such as poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and poor living conditions contributed to the spread of disease. The painting suggests a societal reliance on the church for hope and healing amidst despair.
