        <h1>Prader Willi Syndrome</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artist behind the art piece featuring an individual with Prader-Willi Syndrome remains unknown, although it is indicative of the style prevalent in 19th-century portraiture. This type of art often sought to depict the unique characteristics of individuals, sometimes focusing on medical anomalies and conditions.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This artwork was created during a period when medical conditions were not fully understood, but they aroused scientific curiosity. In the 19th century, exhibitions showcasing individuals with rare conditions were common and reflected both a burgeoning interest in medicine and a societal tendency to treat people with conditions as curiosities. At the time, there was a blend of fascination and misunderstanding regarding genetic and medical anomalies.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The symbolism in the artwork might be interpreted through its focus on the physical form of the individual. The exaggerated portrayal could emphasize the social stigmas attached to differences in body size and shape, depicted as both a subject of curiosity and a normal human condition. The juxtaposition of the individual’s dignified posture with their distinctive physical characteristics might suggest a commentary on the dignity of all human beings, regardless of physical appearance.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The art piece uses elements of realism, prevalent in portrait art of the era. The use of light and shadow highlights the subject's physical form, with attention to texture and volume. The rich, dark colors and the details of clothing and background contribute to a sense of depth and prominence, emphasizing the individual's presence and societal role—often a reflective mirror held up to Victorian attitudes towards the human condition.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This artwork highlights the societal inequities of the 19th century, notably how individuals with visible medical conditions were often marginalized. They were displayed for public curiosity rather than receiving understanding or medical support. Such portrayals could perpetuate stereotypes and stigmas, feeding into broader social dynamics of exclusion and prejudice against those who did not fit societal norms.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic condition resulting from the loss of function of specific genes on chromosome 15. This condition is characterized by hypotonia, feeding difficulties in infancy, subsequent hyperphagia leading to obesity, intellectual disabilities, and endocrine problems. It highlights the broad spectrum of physical, behavioral, and mental challenges faced by those affected.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The individual in the portrait shows classic signs of Prader-Willi Syndrome, such as obesity, which results from hyperphagia. The artwork visually represents these physical markers, showing how the condition manifests externally and the impact it has on the individual's health and appearance.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment for Prader-Willi Syndrome requires a comprehensive approach, including dietary management, physical therapy, and possibly hormone therapy, particularly growth hormone. Psychological and social support are crucial for improving the quality of life. During the 19th century, however, such treatments were not available, often leading to severe health complications.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The social determinants of illness depicted in the artwork reflect the lack of medical understanding and resources available at the time. Economic and social barriers would likely prevent access to emerging medical treatments. Furthermore, societal attitudes towards individuals with visible differences exacerbated the challenges faced by them, affecting their social integration and access to care.</p>
