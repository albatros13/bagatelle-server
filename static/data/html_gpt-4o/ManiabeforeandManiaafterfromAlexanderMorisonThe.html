        <h1>Mania before and Mania after by Alexander Morison</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Alexander Morison was a notable Scottish psychiatrist born in 1779, celebrated for his pioneering contributions to the field of mental health and psychiatry. As an artist, Morison utilized his skills to create detailed illustrations aiming not only to depict mental illness but also to articulate the nuances and complexities of psychiatric conditions during his time.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The artwork "Mania before and Mania after" emerged in the early 19th century, a period characterized by significant developments in medicine and psychiatry. During this era, societal attitudes towards mental illness were beginning to shift, moving from a perception of moral failing towards an understanding of mental disorders as medical conditions. This development coincided with the industrial revolution, which brought massive social and cultural change.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h2>
        <p>In "Mania before and Mania after," the symbolism is profound. The contrasting states of the subject—depicted in both a manic and subdued state—highlight the dualities inherent in mental health conditions. The illustrations serve as a critical visual narrative of transformation and recovery, common in psychiatric discourse during the 19th century. The posture and expressions of the subject embody the struggle and subsequent tranquility that characterize the journey through mental health treatment.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork’s style reflects the precision and clarity that is typical of academic medical illustrations of the era. Emphasizing line and form, Morison’s work is executed with meticulous attention to anatomical detail, which aids in the medical understanding of the subject's state. The composition, with its focus on the subject in isolation, underscores the personal nature of the psychiatric experience.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This artwork underscores social inequalities of the time, particularly regarding mental health treatment. The 19th century was marked by significant disparities in access to care, where individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds often had limited access to emerging psychiatric treatments. The portrayal of mental illness by Morison also reflects the societal biases that viewed such conditions with skepticism and often resulted in marginalization.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Mania, as depicted by Morison, is a psychiatric disorder characterized by elevated mood, hyperactivity, and inflated self-esteem, often followed by periods of depression. The etiology of mania was not well understood during Morison's time but is now known to result from complex interplays of genetic, biochemical, and environmental factors.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The signs of mania as captured in Morison’s work include the tense posture and intense facial expressions, demonstrating the heightened energy and impulsivity associated with the disorder. The transition to a calmer demeanor in the subsequent depiction may symbolize the therapeutic interventions effective during Morison's study period.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Morison's time, treatments for mania were rudimentary by modern standards. Methods such as phlebotomy, dietary restrictions, and sedatives were common. Advances since the 19th century have brought more effective treatments such as psychotherapy, mood stabilizers, and more nuanced pharmaceutical regimes.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social determinants such as poverty, social stress, and lack of access to healthcare significantly affect the prevalence and management of mental illnesses like mania. Morison's depiction indirectly highlights these issues by implying the necessity of comprehensive treatment, which was not widely accessible during his era.</p>
