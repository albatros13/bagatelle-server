        <h1>Hobbes on Optic Nerve</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This artwork is a part of Thomas Hobbes's treatise on optics, created in 1646. Hobbes, primarily known as a philosopher, also engaged deeply with the sciences, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the Renaissance humanists.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>The artwork originates from the mid-17th century, a time characterized by the rise of scientific inquiry and a departure from purely theological worldviews in Europe. This era saw the burgeoning of optics and anatomy studies as part of the Scientific Revolution.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The drawing symbolizes the link between perception and understanding, using the eye and brain connection as an iconographic representation of how vision informs knowledge. It reflects the quest to empirically understand the natural world and human physiology.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork employs detailed line work and shading to accurately represent anatomical structures, characteristic of scientific illustrations of the time. The precise and clear delineations highlight the importance of accuracy in scientific documentation.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This artwork was produced in a period when access to scientific knowledge was largely limited to the educated elite, predominantly white men in Europe, reflecting broader societal inequities in education and literacy.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The drawing, while not depicting a specific disease, is crucial in understanding how diseases of the optic nerve and brain can affect perception and cognition, laying groundwork for correlations between visual and neurological disorders.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The detailed depiction of the optic nerve and its connection to the brain can help identify signs of nerve damage or deterioration, essential in diagnosing conditions like multiple sclerosis or optic neuritis.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In Hobbes's time, optic and neurological disorders were often misunderstood and treatments were rudimentary. Today, understanding this connection aids in developing treatments, such as corticosteroids for optic neuritis to reduce inflammation.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and education significantly impact the management and treatment of illnesses affecting the optic nerve and brain, as knowledge of neuroscience and medicine continually evolves.</p>
