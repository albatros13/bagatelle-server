        <h1>Woodcut of Anatomical Dissection</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This woodcut is often attributed to artists from the early modern period in Europe, though specific individuals are difficult to identify. During this era, artists were often craftsmen working in workshops rather than solitary figures, and their works were often unsigned. The technique of woodcut was prevalent among European artists who wanted to produce multiple copies of an image.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The woodcut depicting an anatomical dissection originates around the late 15th to early 16th century, a transformative period in Europe marked by the Renaissance. This was a time of renewed interest in science, anatomy, and the human experience. Anatomical studies began to break away from the simplistic and symbolic representations prevalent in medieval times, paving the way for more scientific and empirical approaches to the body.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The imagery of an anatomical dissection signifies the burgeoning acceptance of empirical, observation-based science over religious and superstitious explanations of the human body. The seated figure often symbolizes authority or the faculty overseeing the dissection, indicating the societal prominence placed on academic and medical authority.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>This artwork showcases the linear qualities and stark contrasts typical of woodcuts, where the design is incised onto blocks of wood. The emphasis on line and contrast serves to highlight the figures within the scene. The composition organizes focus primarily on the dissected cadaver, guiding viewers' eyes through the anatomical procedure. Spatial arrangement is used to emphasize functions within the scene, from the main lecturer to observers and assistants.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The setting of the dissection, often in front of a wealthy and educated audience, signifies the socio-economic disparities of the time. Access to medical knowledge and participation in such academic events were largely restricted to the privileged classes, revealing a dichotomy between the educated elite and the general public.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While this woodcut does not depict a specific disease, the practice of dissection often involved cadavers afflicted with various conditions. In this era, dissection was crucial for understanding pathological changes in dead bodies, providing insights into diseases that were often poorly understood and attributed to humoral imbalances or spiritual causes.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The absence of visible illness in the artwork is deliberate, emphasizing anatomical structures over pathological changes. The primary objective was educational, informing medical students and professionals of the body's layout rather than diseased states, which were largely mysterious at the time.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the Renaissance, treatments were still largely based on humorism and traditional remedies. The shift towards anatomical study did gradually lead to improved surgical techniques, though medicinal practices remained rudimentary by modern standards.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social determinants such as class, accessibility to education, and geographical location heavily influenced health outcomes. Poverty, lack of education, and urban conditions could exacerbate public health issues. The dissection sessions themselves were educational privileges afforded only to those in proximity to academic institutions.</p>
