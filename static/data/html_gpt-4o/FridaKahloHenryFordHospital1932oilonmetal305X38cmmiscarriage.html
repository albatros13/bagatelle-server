        <h1>Frida Kahlo - Henry Ford Hospital (1932)</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Frida Kahlo (1907–1954) was a prominent Mexican artist known for her vivid self-portraits and works rich in symbolism. Her paintings often depicted personal and painful experiences, drawing from indigenous Mexican culture and European influences. Kahlo's unique artistic style has cemented her as a significant figure in the history of art.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>"Henry Ford Hospital" was painted in 1932, during a tumultuous period in Kahlo's life. It comes after a heartbreaking miscarriage while she was in Detroit with her husband, Diego Rivera. This era was marked by the Great Depression's global impact, which led to profound socio-economic changes. In Mexico, it was also a time when many artists sought to forge a new national identity post-Revolution.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting is filled with potent symbolism. The bed represents her vulnerability, the fetus expresses her loss, and other elements like the snail and orchid reflect both pain and femininity. The industrial Detroit backdrop contrasts her intense personal suffering with the rapidly advancing mechanized world.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Kahlo employed a Surrealist style, though she never fully embraced the movement. Her use of bold colors, a flattened perspective, and intense focus on detail are evident. The composition is structured yet imbued with emotional chaos, reflecting her distress and pain.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Kahlo’s work often addressed issues surrounding gender and personal autonomy. In this artwork, the depiction of her miscarriage brings to light the often-overlooked experiences of women, challenging societal norms which typically marginalized such narratives.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The painting depicts the aftermath of a miscarriage. This untimely loss can be attributed to various factors, including physical trauma from Kahlo's earlier bus accident and potential medical complications not widely understood or managed effectively at the time.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The blood signifies the physical trauma. The image of the fetus represents the direct result of her condition, emphasizing the connection between physical ailments and emotional pain. Kahlo's own depiction of her body as fractured metaphorically represents the multifaceted trauma she experienced.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the early 20th century, medical treatment for miscarriage was limited. Pain management and rest were likely prescribed. Psychological support was rare, reflecting broader limitations in understanding mental health consequences associated with such traumatic experiences.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Kahlo’s health was profoundly influenced by her socio-economic background, her lack of access to advanced medical care, and the trauma from both her accident and societal expectations of womanhood. These factors exacerbated her physical and emotional suffering.</p>
