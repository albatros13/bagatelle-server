        <h1>Juan Carreño de Miranda - Portrait of Charles II (1685)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Juan Carreño de Miranda was a Spanish painter known for his baroque style and his contributions to the court of Spain. Working primarily during the late 17th century, Carreño de Miranda became renowned for his portraits of the Spanish royal family, including King Charles II. His works often encapsulated the aesthetics of the Habsburg dynasty with their intricate attention to detail and somber yet evocative palette.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The painting dates back to 1685, a period when Spain was under the rule of Charles II, the last Habsburg monarch of the Spanish Empire. The socio-political landscape of Spain at this time was characterized by a decline in imperial power, economic instability, and tensions due to the succession crisis. Charles II’s reign was notable for the pervasive influence of his court and struggles owing to dynastic intermarriage, which significantly impacted his health and leadership.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The portrait employs rich iconography to convey the status and authority of Charles II. The dark, opulent robes and the emblematic collar of the Golden Fleece symbolize royal dignity and the burdens of kingship. The stark contrast between the king’s attire and his physically frail appearance also subtly highlights the personal and sovereign disparities faced by Charles II.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Carreño de Miranda utilized a baroque style characterized by dramatic use of shadow and light, lending depth to the portrayal of Charles II. The painter’s use of chiaroscuro not only enhances the texture of the royal garments but also subtly emphasizes the vulnerability of the king’s physical condition. The painting's compositional balance and restrained color palette further enhance its introspective mood.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Charles II’s life and reign were marked by significant social and political inequalities, reflective of broader systemic issues within the Spanish monarchy. The aristocracy maintained power while common citizens endured economic hardship. Additionally, Charles II’s physical and mental health issues stemmed from generations of Habsburg inbreeding, illustrating the implications of dynastic prioritization over individual well-being.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Charles II suffered from numerous health problems throughout his life, attributed to the genetic repercussions of the Habsburg dynasty’s extensive incest. Conditions such as the Habsburg jaw and neurological impairments plagued the monarch, resulting in physical weakness and mental challenges.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The portrait itself evidences notable physical attributes, such as Charles’s elongated face and protruding lower jaw, hallmarks of mandibular prognathism. His frail physique and sagging features suggest chronic illness and bodily fragility, visible testaments to his hereditary conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Medical treatments available to Charles II were primitive by modern standards. Remedies often involved superstitions and rudimentary practices, failing to address the genetic nature of his conditions. Attempts at healing, such as bloodletting and herbal remedies, were largely ineffective.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The intertwined social determinants of health that affected Charles II included genetic lineage, courtly pressures, and lack of medical understanding. The expectation to maintain pure dynastic bloodlines led to genetic vulnerabilities, while societal taboos and ignorance of genetic disorders compounded his afflictions.</p>
