        <h1>Acupuncture Print circa 100 BC: An Analysis</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This particular acupuncture print is not attributed to a specific artist but is representative of the ancient Chinese medical tradition. During this era, practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) produced detailed illustrations of the human body, elucidating the meridians and points used in acupuncture.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The print originates from around 100 BC, during the Han Dynasty in China, a significant period for the development of TCM. This era was marked by a burgeoning interest in systematic approaches to health and medicine. Acupuncture, a key component of TCM, gained prominence as a methodological treatment for various ailments, bridging natural philosophy and practical healthcare.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The illustration symbolizes the interconnectedness of the body’s internal energies, known as "Qi". The various points, or “Jingmai”, serve to direct this energy. Each point corresponds to different organ systems and mental states, reflecting the holistic nature of TCM where physical, emotional, and environmental factors are intertwined.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The print utilizes line work to delineate acupuncture points and meridians, with a simplistic yet precise aesthetic typical of early medical diagrams. The vertical and horizontal arrangements enhance readability and educational utility. The style embodies clarity and functionality, emphasizing precision over artistic embellishment.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Within its historical context, access to TCM practices like acupuncture varied across social strata. Predominantly the literate and elite had direct access to these texts and the healthcare knowledge they contained, marginalizing less educated and rural populations. This disparity reflects the broader socio-cultural inequities of the era.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Acupuncture within TCM posits that diseases result from disruptions in Qi flow and meridian blockages. These disruptions may arise from emotional disturbances, environmental stressors, or dietary imbalances. Restoring harmony in the body’s energy pathways is believed to alleviate disease and restore health.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Signs of illness in this context may include palpable nodules at acupuncture points, disturbances in pulse, or observable imbalances in bodily functions. Acupuncturists thus rely on these somatic cues to diagnose energy disruptions and plan treatments.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The treatment involves the strategic insertion of fine needles into the identified acupuncture points to restore energy balance and promote healing. By stimulating these points, practitioners aim to unblock pathways and restore the optimal flow of Qi throughout the body.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The social context of an individual, including their emotional well-being, lifestyle, and societal interactions, significantly influences their health within the TCM framework. A holistic understanding of these factors guides acupuncture treatment, viewing health as an intertwined web of personal and environmental elements.</p>
