        <h1>T Bin Harlem by Alice Neel (1940)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            Alice Neel, born in 1900, was a distinguished American painter known for her expressionistic portraits. Neel's work is characterized by its profound psychological insight and emotional intensity. She lived and worked in various multicultural neighborhoods, most notably Spanish Harlem, which served as an influential backdrop for her work during the 1930s and 40s, the period when she painted "T Bin Harlem."
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>
            The painting “T Bin Harlem” was completed in 1940, a time when Harlem was a cultural hub for African Americans facing socio-economic challenges. The period was marked by the Great Depression, which exacerbated health disparities and living conditions in urban America. Tuberculosis was a rampant disease affecting densely populated regions, with the African American community experiencing higher infection rates due to poverty and crowded living environments.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>
            Neel’s choice to depict a person suffering from tuberculosis in Harlem symbolizes the broader struggle against social injustices and health inequalities. The emaciated form and somber expression of the subject reflect suffering and resilience. The artwork acts as a cultural critique, evoking empathy and awareness regarding the neglected health crises of marginalized communities.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>
            Neel’s expressionistic style in "T Bin Harlem" employs bold lines and muted colors, drawing attention to the subject's frailty. Her use of exaggerated features emphasizes the emotional and physical agony. The stark contrast between light and shadow highlights the dramatic reality faced by individuals suffering from disease, while using a relatively minimalistic background to keep the focus on the subject.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            The painting underscores the stark health disparities prevalent at the time, with African American communities being disproportionately affected by tuberculosis. It highlights the lack of adequate medical care and the socio-economic factors contributing to the spread of the disease, such as poor living conditions and inadequate nutrition.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease typically affecting the lungs, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The disease spreads through airborne particles when an infected person coughs or sneezes. During the early 20th century, TB was a leading cause of death, often linked to poverty and overcrowded living conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            In Neel’s painting, the subject’s evident weight loss and physical weakness are indicative of systemic tuberculosis infection. TB symptoms often include chronic cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss, all of which contribute to the emaciated and weakened appearance of patients.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            During the 1940s, treatments for TB were limited before the advent of antibiotics like Streptomycin. Patients were often isolated in sanatoria to prevent the disease's spread. Nutritional support, rest, and fresh air were the primary treatments, highlighting the socio-economic disparities in accessing effective healthcare.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Factors such as housing, income, education, and access to healthcare significantly impacted the prevalence and treatment outcomes of tuberculosis. The socio-economic conditions of Harlem exacerbated the spread and mortality rates of tuberculosis during this period, as depicted in Neel’s poignant work.
