        <h1>Anatomical Study by Leonardo da Vinci</h1>
        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe:</strong> Leonardo da Vinci, a renowned polymath of the Italian Renaissance, was not only a master painter but also a dedicated scientist and anatomist. His rigorous studies of the human body have contributed significantly to the fields of art and medicine.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame):</strong> Created during the late 15th and early 16th centuries, this artwork is a reflection of the Renaissance's thirst for knowledge and a deeper understanding of the natural world. The Renaissance period was characterized by a revival of learning, exploration of new scientific ideas, and the merging of art with science.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography:</strong> Leonardo's anatomical drawings use iconographic techniques often employed in his artistic endeavors. The precise delineation of the musculature and skeletal structures can be seen as a symbol of the pursuit of understanding the complexity of the human form and the interconnectedness of body and soul.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design):</strong> Leonardo's drawings exemplify the use of line, detail, and perspective, foundational elements of Renaissance art. His use of chiaroscuro enhances the three-dimensionality of the anatomical forms, a technique he mastered as seen in works like the "Mona Lisa." Leonardo’s integration of scientific accuracy with artistic beauty remains influential.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities:</strong> While Leonardo’s work was groundbreaking, it also highlights the inequities of his time. Access to the knowledge and skills required for dissection and artistic rendering was exclusive to a privileged few. This reflects broader societal limitations where scientific and artistic advancements were often confined to elite circles.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology:</strong> Although not explicitly depicting a diseased state, Leonardo’s work laid the groundwork for future medical illustration, aiding in the understanding of normal versus pathological anatomy. His investigation into body structures provided insight into how diseases could manifest themselves through anatomical changes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness:</strong> Leonardo’s detailed studies reveal an acute awareness of muscular and skeletal structures, which later generations used to identify deviations indicative of illness or injury. His work suggests an early interest in the visual signs of health and pathology, though less explicit in terms of actual diseases depicted.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[h] Treatment:</strong> Leonardo's anatomical studies primarily served educational purposes, providing visual aids for understanding human physiology. His innovative approach set the stage for more detailed medical examinations and treatments that would arise from a better understanding of human anatomy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness:</strong> The very ability to perform dissections was limited, reflecting societal beliefs about the sacredness of the body and religious prohibitions. Social determinants, including education, wealth, and religious beliefs, significantly influenced who could access and benefit from this knowledge.</p>
