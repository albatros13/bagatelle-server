        <h1>The Agnew Clinic by Thomas Eakins</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Thomas Eakins, an American artist, was known for his realist approach and detailed portrayal of the human figure. Born in 1844 in Philadelphia, Eakins spent most of his career capturing domestic and medical scenes, highlighting his profound interest in anatomy and the human body. His work, "The Agnew Clinic," exemplifies his mastery of capturing the intricacies of surgical procedures and the people involved.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 1889, "The Agnew Clinic" is set against the backdrop of a transforming medical world. The late 19th century was a significant period in medical history, with innovations in antiseptic surgery and anesthesia. Eakins painted this piece for the University of Pennsylvania's Dr. D. Hayes Agnew upon his retirement, encapsulating contemporary surgical practices of the era.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting is rife with symbolism, highlighting themes of knowledge, education, and medical advancement. The presence of medical students observing the surgery underscores the emphasis on education. Dr. Agnew, standing in the painting, represents wisdom and authority. The surgical scene illustrates the progressiveness in medical research and practice during that period.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Eakins employed a realist style using a somber color palette, focusing on light and shadow to draw attention to certain areas within the scene. The composition is carefully structured, guiding the viewer's eye from the cluster of students to Dr. Agnew and the operating table. The detailed depiction of figures and materials showcases Eakins’ dedication to accuracy and his artistic prowess in rendering human anatomy.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting can also be analyzed through the lens of social and cultural inequities. All subjects in the painting are male, reflecting the gender dynamics of the time where women were excluded from formal medical education and practice. The lack of diversity in ethnicity further highlights the socio-cultural disparities in the field of medicine during the 19th century.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While "The Agnew Clinic" doesn't specify a particular disease, it is understood to depict a surgical procedure related to cancer treatment, potentially a mastectomy. The late 19th century saw significant developments in understanding and treating cancer surgically, coinciding with increased knowledge about bacterial infections and sterilization techniques.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The painting includes clear indicators of surgical intervention, from the patient's exposed body to the stained linens used during operations. These elements highlight the realities of surgical procedures and the medical tools and practices employed during that era, signaling the transition from rudimentary practices to more systematic, effective surgeries.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The surgical scene depicted reflects the medical advancements in treatment techniques, such as improved surgical tools and anesthesia, allowing for more complex and less painful procedures. It was an era on the cusp of modern surgical methods, which would eventually transform into the practices seen today.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The artwork subtly highlights socioeconomic factors influencing healthcare access and illness prevalence. Differences in socio-economic status could determine one’s access to emerging medical technologies and treatments. The congregation of educated individuals in the painting contrasts sharply with the broader populace's access to equivalent care.</p>
