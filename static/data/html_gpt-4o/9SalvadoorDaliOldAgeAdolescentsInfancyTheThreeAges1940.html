        <h1>Salvador Dali - Old Age, Adolescence, Infancy (The Three Ages)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Salvador Dalí, a leading figure in the Surrealist movement, painted "Old Age, Adolescence, Infancy (The Three Ages)" in 1940. Known for his striking and often bizarre images, Dalí's work explores the subconscious through dreamlike visuals.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The painting was created during a tumultuous period marked by global conflict and political turmoil. The onset of World War II and the Spanish Civil War heavily influenced Dali’s work, adding layers of complexity and disquiet to his art.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>This masterpiece employs rich symbolism, presenting three phases of life: infancy, adolescence, and old age. Dalí uses visual metaphors to explore themes of time and existential reflection, often blurring the lines between stages with surreal imagery.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Dalí’s use of precise detail and dreamlike sequences exemplifies the Surrealist style. His application of distortion and juxtaposition challenges visual perception and encourages viewers to consider the subconscious meanings.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Though not overt in this work, Dalí’s art often alludes to class and societal structures. The layered nature of this piece could be interpreted as a discourse on the passage of time and the inevitable decay that ignores societal status.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Within the surreal forms, it is possible to derive an allegory for Alzheimer’s disease, where memory and identity deteriorate over time. Dalí’s portrayal of fading life stages can echo the progressive nature of such conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Elements like distorted figures and decay might symbolize cognitive decline. These visual cues can represent confusion and the gradual loss of identity associated with neurodegenerative illnesses.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the 1940s, understanding and treatment of Alzheimer's were limited. Contemporary insights focus more on management and delay progression through medical intervention and cognitive therapies.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The portrayal of life stages might implicitly comment on environmental factors influencing health. Access to care, education, and socio-economic status are critical in managing and understanding neurodegenerative diseases today.</p>
