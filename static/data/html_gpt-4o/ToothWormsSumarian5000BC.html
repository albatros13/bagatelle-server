        <h1>Tooth Worms: Sumarian BC (5000)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        <p>The concept depicted in the artwork of "Tooth Worms" from Sumerian civilization is rooted in ancient Mesopotamian culture. Although the artist remains unknown, this depiction is reflective of Sumerian medical myths. The Sumerians, one of the first civilizations, were known for their advances in writing, law, and architecture but also for their mythological interpretations of disease.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This artwork dates back to circa 5000 BC, during a period where Sumerian culture thrived in Mesopotamia. The period was characterized by urban development, complex religious systems, and the emergence of written language. In this context, the art served as a way to try to understand and depict ailments based on prevailing beliefs.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The depiction of worms inside a tooth reflects early beliefs in medical etiologies. The tooth worm theory suggested that dental decay and pain were caused by worms within the teeth. This iconography was a symbolic representation of unseen causes of illness, drawing from natural observations and mythical interpretations.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork uses a combination of realistic and symbolic elements. Carved in relief, it shows attention to detail and spatial representation. The symmetry and balance in the depiction of worms weaving through teeth reflect an understanding of naturalistic forms and early attempts to understand human anatomy.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Sumerian society, like many early civilizations, had distinct social hierarchies. Knowledge and resources for health care and treatment were likely reserved for the elite, with common beliefs like the tooth worm serving as explanations for the wider populace subject to less understanding and access to medical treatment.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The depicted disease relates to dental caries, a common affliction, particularly painful in societies without advanced dental techniques. The etiology ascribed was mythical, reflecting early attempts to diagnose based on observable effects, without modern scientific insight.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The artwork captures visible pain and destruction associated with dental decay, translating these symptoms into the visible form of worms inside the structure of the tooth. It reflects recognition of pain and damage but through a mythologized lens.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments in ancient Sumer likely included ritualistic and early herbal remedies, derived from a combination of superstition and primitive medical practices. Incantations and symbolic removal of 'worms' might have been part of the attempted treatment methods.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The understanding of tooth ailments within social contexts mattered; occupation, diet, and access to rudimentary health care influenced dental health. High carbohydrate diets could exacerbate decay, while lack of resources limited effective responses.</p>
