        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The image presented is a prime example of medieval medical illustration. While the specific artist is not documented, such illustrations were often created by monks or early physicians as part of medical manuscripts. These illustrations were a crucial part of educating practitioners about human anatomy and medical procedures.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>This illustration likely originates from the late medieval period, a time when medicine was heavily influenced by religious and superstitious beliefs. The socio-cultural setting of this era was defined by a limited understanding of human biology, and medicine was often intertwined with mysticism and astrology.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The anatomical figure depicted is a "Wound Man," a common subject in medical literature of the time. The wounds and instruments throughout the body symbolized various medical conditions and treatments. Each wound serves as an icon, representing common injuries or ailments along with possible remedies, underscoring the harsh realities of medieval life.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The illustration employs a linear style common in medieval manuscripts, focusing on clear outlines and detailed labeling to convey information effectively. This art prioritizes didactic function over aesthetic complexity, using text and image together to create an instructive narrative.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During this period, access to medical knowledge was largely limited to clerics and the wealthy. Such illustrations rarely addressed the needs of the broader, impoverished population who suffered most from untreated wounds and illnesses due to a lack of access to professional medical care.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The wounds depicted could represent a variety of ailments from the period, including infections, battlefield injuries, and maladies like the plague. The etiology, or cause of these conditions, was poorly understood, and often falsely attributed to humoral imbalances or divine retribution.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Common signs and symptoms represented include open wounds, bloodletting sites, and distended limbs. These were visual indicators of various pathological states such as infections, which, given the lack of antiseptics, were a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment methods depicted include bloodletting and foreign body removal, reflecting the rudimentary and often harmful medical practices of the time. The tools shown are indicative of surgical techniques available, which were basic and had limited success.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social factors contributing to the prevalence of disease included malnutrition, poor sanitation, and lack of public health infrastructure. The stratification of society meant that the poor suffered disproportionately from disease, with limited means for obtaining treatment.</p>
