        <h1>Jan Steen - The Doctor's Visit</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
            Jan Steen, a prominent Dutch Golden Age painter, was known for his vivid and often humorous depictions of daily life. His artworks provide a window into 17th-century Dutch society, emphasizing social interactions and moral lessons.

            <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
            Painted between 1658 and 1662, "The Doctor's Visit" reflects the socio-cultural milieu of the Dutch Republic's Golden Age. During this period, the middle class flourished, and there was an increasing interest in genre scenes that depicted daily life with moral undertones.

            <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
            The scene in "The Doctor's Visit" is laden with symbolism. The weary patient, the concerned doctor, and the curious onlookers represent the interplay between human vulnerability and medical practices of the time. The inclusion of a dog, often a symbol of loyalty, juxtaposes the fleeting nature of health and the permanence of companionship.

            <h2>Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
            Jan Steen's composition employs chiaroscuro to direct focus and create depth. His characteristic use of warm colors conveys a sense of familiarity and comfort, while intricate details engage viewers, encouraging them to contemplate the underlying narrative.

            <h2>Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
            The painting subtly highlights the disparities in healthcare access and the limitations of medical knowledge in the 17th century. The reliance on folk remedies and the role of socio-economic status in determining treatment outcomes are subtly critiqued through Steen's meticulous attention to detail.

            <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
            The exact ailment depicted in "The Doctor's Visit" is open to interpretation. However, the exhausted expression of the patient suggests a chronic condition or possibly a febrile illness that often plagued people in this era due to poor hygiene and lack of vaccinations.

            <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
            Notable signs are the patient's pale complexion and lethargic demeanor. These visual cues align with common illnesses of the time, such as anemia or infectious diseases that were rampant before modern medical advancements.

            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            Medical practices during the Dutch Golden Age were rudimentary. Physicians often relied on humoral theory, balancing bodily fluids to treat ailments. The scene in Steen's painting may depict a physician prescribing bed rest or herbal remedies, common treatments during this period.

            <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
            The painting illustrates how living conditions, dietary habits, and social status influenced health outcomes. Overcrowded living spaces and limited nutritional intake contributed to widespread health issues among the lower classes.
