        <h1>Annotated Female Acupuncture Model</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The annotated female acupuncture model is an example of Chinese medical art likely created during the Ming Dynasty. Although the exact artist is unknown, these models were typically crafted by artisans skilled in traditional Chinese medicine and medical illustrations.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Acupuncture has been a key component of traditional Chinese medicine for over two millennia, but its formal documentation as a practice significantly developed during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). This period was marked by a blossoming of cultural, scientific, and medical advancements in China, with acupuncture gaining prominence not only as a healing art but as a scientifically documented practice.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The model is heavily annotated with holes and inscriptions, each representing an acupuncture point. These are crucial in traditional Chinese medicine, symbolizing the flow of qi (vital energy) through the meridian lines in the body. Each point has a specific function and influence over the body's health, making the model a visual map of healing potential.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The model is both a scientific and artistic creation, featuring a realistic human form meticulously detailed to display acupuncture points. The balance and proportion of the model are grounded in realism, while the inscriptions add a layer of complexity and functionality indicative of the Ming aesthetic, which combined artistic beauty with practical use.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During the Ming Dynasty, access to acupuncture and such detailed models was typically reserved for scholars and the elite. Common people had limited access to comprehensive medical knowledge, reflecting a broader societal inequity in healthcare accessibility, which persists in varying forms even today.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The diseases typically addressed by acupuncture, as depicted by models like this, range from physical pain to internal issues such as digestive problems, often described in traditional terms such as imbalances of qi, yin, and yang within the body.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In acupuncture models, specific points correlate with signs of imbalance. Pain, discomfort, or disease is believed to occur when qi flow is blocked or imbalanced. Pathological states are often described in relation to the balance of elements, such as fire, earth, or water, within the body.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Acupuncture treatment involves inserting fine needles into these calculated points to restore equilibrium and health. Each point can directly affect specific organs or functions, offering personalized treatment plans based on the individual's symptoms and traditional diagnosis.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as diet, lifestyle, environment, and emotion significantly influence one's health in traditional Chinese medicine. These determinants highlight the holistic approach to health and wellness that such models illustrate, emphasizing prevention as much as cure.</p>
