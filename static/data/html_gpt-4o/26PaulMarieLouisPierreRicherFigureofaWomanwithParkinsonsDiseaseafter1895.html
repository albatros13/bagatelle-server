        <h1>Figure of a Woman with Parkinson's Disease</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Paul Marie Louis Pierre Richer was a notable French anatomist, physiologist, and sculptor. Alongside his academic pursuits, Richer is recognized for his vivid artistic representations that often depict human anatomy and medical conditions. His work bridges the gap between art and science, illustrating his understanding and perspective on various medical conditions through sculpture.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The sculpture "Figure of a Woman with Parkinson's Disease" dates back to the period after 1895, a time when medical science was gradually evolving with breakthroughs and increased understanding of diseases. This was a transformational period marked by the industrial revolution and significant advancements in medical science across Europe. Those years witnessed the intersection of art and emerging medical knowledge, as seen in Richer’s work.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The sculpture represents more than just the physical appearance of Parkinson's disease. It symbolizes the struggles and resilience of individuals living with chronic illnesses. Through the medium of sculpture, Richer managed to encapsulate the essence of the human condition, marked by suffering, perseverance, and dignity.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Richer’s statues are well known for their raw realism and meticulous attention to anatomical detail. The use of exaggerated posture and detailed musculature in this sculpture reflects the physical manifestations of Parkinson’s disease, giving it a lifelike quality that is both educational and evocative.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During the late 19th century, healthcare was not as accessible as it is today, and societal understanding of diseases like Parkinson's was limited. The depiction of such ailments in art brought awareness to public health issues and the disparities faced by those who could not afford medical care.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. The disease is characterized by tremors, stiffness, and bradykinesia. Its etiology is linked to the depletion of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, but the cause remains largely unknown, with both genetic and environmental factors being considered.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In this sculpture, Richer illustrates key symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including the stooped posture and muscular rigidity. These elements are integral in medical sculptures as they visually communicate specific characteristics of diseases for educational purposes.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the late 19th century, treatment options for Parkinson's disease were limited. Current therapies focus on managing symptoms through medications that increase dopamine levels, physical therapy, and in some cases, surgical intervention like deep brain stimulation.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and education play significant roles in the diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease. During Richer’s time, these factors would have greatly influenced patient outcomes and public awareness of the condition.</p>
