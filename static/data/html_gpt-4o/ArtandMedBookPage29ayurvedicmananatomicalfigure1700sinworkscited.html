        <h2>Ayurvedic Man Anatomical Figure 1700s</h2>
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork of the "Ayurvedic Man" is an anonymous creation, typical of Indian medical art traditions. It reflects the collective knowledge of practitioners involved in Ayurveda and reflects the vibrant medical culture of India during the 1700s. This piece encapsulates a blend of spiritual, medical, and artistic endeavors which are characteristically anonymous in the way folk and scholarly knowledge is shared transgenerationally in Indian culture.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>In the 1700s, India was a land of thriving traditional practices and at the same time, under strong influence due to colonial expansions. The period marked an increased exchange of medical knowledge between the East and the West, contributing to a global understanding of health practices. Ayurveda, being the traditional Indian system of medicine, played a central role in promoting holistic healthcare. The Ayurvedic man illustration represents this era’s attempt to systematically codify knowledge related to anatomy and physiology, which was inherently linked to spiritual understanding.</p>
        
        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The Ayurvedic man stands as a symbolic representation of the universe within the body, with a focus on the interconnectedness of bodily systems. Each part of the body corresponds to elemental forces and is depicted in balance. The chakras, doshas, and marma points are depicted through symbols, emphasizing the integration of bodily and spiritual health. This complex iconography is not merely anatomical but holds a cosmological significance, viewing the body as a microcosm of the larger universe.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>The design of the Ayurvedic man employs symmetry and balance, both key principles of design that are instrumental in portraying the equanimity required in Ayurvedic philosophy. The line work is consistent, fluid, and deliberate, emphasizing clarity and precision, which is essential for understanding anatomical features. The artwork uses minimalistic forms and earthy colors that reflect the natural elements to instill a sense of calm and focus.</p>
        
        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>During this period, access to medical knowledge and practices such as those depicted by this piece was often limited by social hierarchies. While Ayurveda highlighted communal wellness, the practical application of such knowledge was often reserved for higher classes or those initiated into the practice. The inequity in distribution and application of medical care and knowledge reflects the broader socio-cultural stratification of the time.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The art depicts various systems and organs, illustrating an understanding of disease as an imbalance within these systems. Ayurvedic theory believes that diseases are caused by an imbalance in the doshas—Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These imbalances are usually due to lifestyle, diet, and environmental factors and are represented within the illustration by their associated bodily locations.</p>
        
        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Within the Ayurvedic framework, signs of illness are denoted through the depiction of certain organs and systems in imbalanced states, symbolized through variations in color and form. Such visual signifiers aim to communicate alterations from health to illness and reflect an early understanding of symptomatology without invasive methods.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment within Ayurveda is holistic, emphasizing dietary changes, herbal remedies, and lifestyle modifications. The illustration underlines this through its depiction of balanced doshas. Treatment seeks to restore equilibrium by correcting lifestyle habits or addressing specific elemental imbalances, often through prescribed routines and natural connections.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The artwork implicitly points at various social determinants like environment, diet, and social behavior influencing health. Stress, as a social byproduct, is also componentially addressed. This period underscored significant natural determinants, with the understanding that a harmonized environment led to a healthy body.</p>
