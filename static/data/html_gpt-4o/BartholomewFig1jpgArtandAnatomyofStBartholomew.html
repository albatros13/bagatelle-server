        <h2>Bartholomew Anatomy of St Bartholomew</h2>
        <p>

            <strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</strong><br>
            The artwork depicting the anatomy of St. Bartholomew belongs to the domain of religious art, often created by anonymous artisans affiliated with ecclesiastical institutions during the medieval period. It reflects a style typical of the late Gothic tradition, characterized by its dramatic depiction of biblical scenes.

            <strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</strong><br>
            This painting was likely produced during the Middle Ages, a period marked by the synthesis of religious devotion and a burgeoning interest in anatomical studies. The church held significant sway over artistic expression, using artwork to depict religious narratives and moral teachings.

            <strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</strong><br>
            The artwork prominently features St. Bartholomew flayed alive, which is a symbol of martyrdom and faith. This gruesome portrayal serves as an iconographic element representing the saint’s unwavering dedication and the trials faced by martyrs. The flaying is also metaphorical for spiritual purification through physical suffering.

            <strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</strong><br>
            The painting employs strong contrasts in color and form to create a visual impact. The use of sharp lines and detailed human anatomy emphasizes the dramatic event. The halo and detachment of skin are elements that draw attention to the dual nature of the saint — as both human and divine.

            <strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</strong><br>
            In its time, the painting could have been reflective of the persecution suffered by early Christians, symbolizing broader social and cultural inequities. The veneration of saints who endured brutal deaths highlighted the inequalities faced by believers in a predominantly non-Christian world.

            <strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</strong><br>
            While the artwork isn’t depicting a literal disease, the act of flaying is symbolic of the ravages of the human body by external forces, similar to the way illness attacks by nature. The emphasis on open wounds illustrates the vulnerability of the human form.

            <strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</strong><br>
            The open wounds and exposed musculature could symbolize corruptibility and infection, which were common themes in religious reflections on sin and corporeality in art. These marks are metaphorical pathologies illustrating inner spiritual afflictions.

            <strong>[h] Treatment</strong><br>
            In the narrative context, treatment is conceptualized as spiritual salvation rather than physical healing. The artwork represents divine intervention as the ultimate salvation, more important than earthly cures. 

            <strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</strong><br>
            The creation of such an artwork reflects the medieval focus on morality and divine justice as determinants of health. Physical ailments were often perceived as divine punishments or trials, influenced by societal beliefs rather than medical understanding.
