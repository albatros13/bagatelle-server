    <h1>An Analysis of "The Plague Burning of Jews Accused of Causing Outbreak" (1340)</h1>
    
    <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
    The artwork in question is anonymous and is a part of the medieval European tradition of illustrated manuscripts. These works were often collaboratively produced by scribes, illuminators, and painters, whose identities have largely been lost to history.

    <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
    This piece dates back to the mid-14th century, a period marked by the devastating outbreak of the Black Death in Europe. The pandemic, which peaked between 1347 and 1351, claimed the lives of an estimated 25 million people, roughly one-third of Europe's population.

    <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
    The illustration depicts the burning of Jews, a harrowing reflection of the anti-Semitic sentiments of the time. During plague outbreaks, Jewish communities were often scapegoated, accused of poisoning wells and spreading disease, leading to brutal pogroms. The painting uses visual storytelling to convey the widespread panic and societal tensions.

    <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance</h2>
    The artwork employs the typical characteristics of medieval manuscript illuminations: vibrant colors, detailed figures, and narrative clarity. Lines are bold and defined, bodies are slightly stylized, and the use of gold leaf (if present) indicates the importance of the depiction.

    <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
    Jews faced severe persecution and discrimination during the plague years. Amidst the panic, they were unjustly blamed for the calamity, leading to massacres and expulsions. This image not only captures that moment in history but also serves as a reminder of the prejudice and violence fueled by fear and ignorance.

    <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
    The Black Death was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which was transmitted to humans via the bites of infected fleas and rats. Symptoms included fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, terrible aches and pains—and then, in short order, death.

    <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
    Victims of the plague typically developed swollen, painful lymph nodes, called buboes, hence its name, the bubonic plague. Black patches formed on the skin due to subdermal hemorrhages, lending the moniker the "Black Death."

    <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
    Medieval treatments were rudimentary and largely ineffective. They included bloodletting, boil-lancing, and folk medicine practices. Notably, quarantine around this period saw its early implementation as a response to the plague.

    <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
    The rapid spread of the plague was exacerbated by poor sanitation, crowded living conditions, and widespread malnutrition, factors heavily influenced by socio-economic status. These determinants illustrate the intersection between healthcare and broader social policies.
