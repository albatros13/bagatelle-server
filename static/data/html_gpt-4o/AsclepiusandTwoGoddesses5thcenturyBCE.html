        <h1>Asclepius and Two Goddesses</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The relief, known as "Asclepius and Two Goddesses," is a quintessential example of ancient Greek sculpture, likely created by anonymous artisans from the Classical period. The identity of individual artists in this era often remains unknown, but the craftsmanship is attributed to the broad artistic brilliance of the Greek civilization, characterized by its expressiveness, realism, and adherence to proportion.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Dating back to the 5th century BCE, this relief belongs to the Classical period of ancient Greece—a time noted for its advancement in arts, philosophy, and science. This era saw the flourishing of city-states like Athens and Sparta, which played critical roles in political and cultural developments. Art during this time was heavily influenced by ideals of harmony, balance, and beauty, reflecting broader societal values. It coincides with the rise of democracy in Athens and the philosophical teachings of Socrates and Plato.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>This artwork features Asclepius, the god of medicine, flanked by two goddesses, likely Hygieia (goddess of health, cleanliness, and sanitation) and Epione (goddess of soothing of pain). Asclepius is often depicted holding a staff with a snake entwined around it—a symbol still associated with medicine today. The presence of these deities together underscores the importance placed on health, healing, and medical practices in Greek society.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The relief showcases the Classical Greek emphasis on idealized human forms, meticulous attention to anatomical detail, and a naturalistic representation of figures. The figures are carved in low relief, demonstrating depth and dimension while maintaining the flatness characteristic of relief work. The composition is carefully balanced, with the deities depicted in a graceful, harmonious arrangement, indicative of the Greeks' pursuit of aesthetic perfection.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>While the Classical period was known for its advancements, it also saw significant social and cultural inequities. Women, for instance, had limited rights and were largely excluded from public life. The depiction of goddesses in art often highlighted idealized feminine forms but did not necessarily translate to improved status for real women. Similarly, the art funded by and created for elite patrons reflected socio-economic disparities of the time.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>In ancient Greek medicine, diseases were often thought to result from an imbalance of the four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Asclepius, as the god of healing, was believed to possess the knowledge to restore this balance, thus curing illnesses. This concept formed the foundation of medical practice in this era, influencing physicians like Hippocrates.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The snake entwined on Asclepius's staff represents the dual nature of health and disease, emblematic of shedding old skin for new—symbolic of rejuvenation. In Greek art and mythology, the snake signified both destruction and healing, reflecting the dual potential inherent in medical practice.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment in ancient Greece often involved a mix of empirical observation and traditional ritualistic practices. Ascribed to Asclepius were healing methods that included dietary regimes, exercises, and sometimes dream interpretations within Asclepian temples. The holistic approach also emphasized the prevention of illness through lifestyle changes.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>In this period, access to medical care was significantly determined by one's social status. While Asclepion temples were available for healing, the quality and type of care varied based on an individual's wealth and position. The insights shared by philosophers on health and body, however, began to democratize some medical understanding.</p>
