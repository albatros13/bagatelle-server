        <h2>Art Historical and Medical Analysis of "The Lepermid Leprosy"</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork, "The Lepermid Leprosy," is attributed to Vincent de Beauvais, a medieval scholar known for his encyclopedic work "Speculum Historiale." Although primarily a writer, the manuscripts associated with his texts often included illustrated miniatures created by artisans of the period. These illustrations capture historical and theological narratives, enriched with vivid imagery.</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>This manuscript dates to the mid-14th century, a period marked by significant social upheaval due to the Black Death and various wars. Leprosy, at this time, was a highly stigmatized disease, often conflated with moral and spiritual decay. The illustration reflects the medieval understanding of illness as both a physical and metaphysical affliction.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The miniature uses symbolism to depict the moral narratives of sin and purity. Architectural motifs, such as the gate, suggest separation, illustrating the exclusion of lepers from society. The figures' gestures and postures convey a somber tone, emphasizing the societal ostracization of those afflicted with leprosy.</p>
        
        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>The artwork is a typical example of Gothic manuscript illumination, characterized by vibrant colors, meticulous detail, and hierarchical compositions. The use of gold leaf both enhances the image's aesthetic and indicates the divine or sacred context often associated with illuminated manuscripts.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Lepers were relegated to the fringes of society, living in isolation in leper colonies. This separation resulted from both health fears and cultural beliefs linking disease to divine punishment. Such societal attitudes underscore the inequities in health perceptions and access to care in medieval times.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Leprosy, also known as Hansen’s disease, is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. It primarily affects the skin, nerves, respiratory tract, and eyes. During the medieval period, leprosy was poorly understood, and fear of its contagious nature led to widespread stigmatization and exile.</p>
        
        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The illustration may depict visible deformities and the use of crutches, which were common symptoms associated with advanced leprosy. Damaged skin and peripheral nerve damage were hallmark signs, contributing to the physical impairments seen in sufferers.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>In medieval times, treatment for leprosy was rudimentary and often intertwined with religious rituals. Lepers were usually isolated in communities where they received basic care but limited medical treatment. Modern treatment involves antibiotic therapy, significantly reducing the disease's impact and spread.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Leprosy's prevalence was closely tied to factors like poverty, overcrowding, and inadequate sanitation, which facilitated the disease's spread. These social determinants contributed to both the physical hardship and social stigma experienced by those afflicted.</p>
