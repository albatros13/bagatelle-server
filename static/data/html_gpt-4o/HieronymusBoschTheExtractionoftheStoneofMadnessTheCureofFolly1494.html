        <h1>The Extraction of the Stone of Madness: Art and Biomedical Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        Hieronymus Bosch, a Dutch painter from the Early Netherlandish painting school, is renowned for his surreal and fantastical imagery. Born around 1450 in 's-Hertogenbosch, Brabant (in present-day Netherlands), Bosch created art that delved into the human psyche, invoking thematic elements of morality, sin, and folly.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        "The Extraction of the Stone of Madness" was painted around 1494, during the late Middle Ages. This period in Europe was marked by a burgeoning interest in science and a shift from medieval to Renaissance thinking. It was a time of religious upheaval and cultural transition, amidst a backdrop of superstition and burgeoning humanism.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        This artwork vividly illustrates a mock surgical procedure aimed at curing folly, symbolized by the extraction of a stone from a patient’s skull. It features iconographic elements like the funnel hat worn by the figure performing the surgery, traditionally associated with tricksters and charlatans. The book balanced on the head of one spectator may symbolize the misuse or misinterpretation of knowledge.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        Bosch’s work utilizes a coherent composition characterized by balanced figures and intricate, fantastical detail. The foreground's dynamic interaction contrasts sharply with the serene background landscape, showcasing Bosch’s skill in creating layered, multifaceted visual stories. His use of transparent glazes enhances depth and tonal variations, highlighting his technical prowess.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        Bosch’s painting implicitly critiques the charlatanism prevalent in medieval medicine. It echoes societal inequalities, where those seeking cures for mental or physical ailments often fell prey to dubious practitioners. The practice of quackery exploited the desperate and uninformed, highlighting the power dynamics between patients and self-proclaimed healers.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        The artwork metaphorically addresses the 'stone of madness', a psychosomatic condition thought to affect the mentally ill during Bosch’s time. Folly was seen as a physical ailment necessitating surgical intervention, reflecting contemporary misunderstandings of mental health without scientific basis.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        The primary signifier of illness in the painting is the act of stone extraction itself. The illness is not clearly represented physically, which underscores the notion that it is not accurately understood. This aligns with historical perceptions that often lacked logical or scientific explanations for mental health conditions.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        The depicted treatment — a surgical extraction — is entirely a fabrication, showcasing historical misconceptions around medical practices. Genuine treatments for mental ailments were rudimentary and often harmful, highlighting the lack of effective psychiatric care available at the time.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        During Bosch's era, mental illness was often stigmatized, with patients subject to rituals and faux surgeries rather than genuine support. Lack of education, poverty, and prevailing religious beliefs influenced the interpretation and treatment of such conditions.
