        <h2>Barbers in the Tomb of Userhat, Amenhotep II, 1438-1312 BC</h2>
        <p><strong>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe:</strong> The artwork found in the Tomb of Userhat is attributed to artisans of Ancient Egypt during the reign of Amenhotep II. These craftsmen were adept at using frescoes to decorate the interiors of tombs, thereby ensuring the stories and cultural practices of the time were preserved for the afterlife.</p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame):</strong> Dating back to circa 1438-1312 BC, this period was marked by the consolidation of the New Kingdom of Egypt, a time characterized by prosperity, expansive building projects, and a stable government. The culture placed a significant emphasis on religious rites and the afterlife, often reflected in the art and architecture of the time.</p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography:</strong> The scene depicting barbers is more than a record of daily life; it symbolizes the societal order and practice of grooming, which was an important aspect of Egyptian culture. Barbers were seen as custodians of appearance and hygiene, central to rituals and social ceremonies. The tools depicted, like razors and shears, represent the technological advancement of the era.</p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design):</strong> This fresco uses a blend of line, shape, and color typical of Egyptian tomb art. The figures are presented in profile, adhering to the stylistic norm of the time. The use of hierarchical proportion, where figures of higher status are depicted as larger, maintains the social hierarchy visually. The colors are earth-toned, with a limited palette including red, ochre, and green, reflecting the materials available and symbolic choices.</p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities:</strong> Even in this portrayal of a seemingly mundane activity, the class distinctions are clear. Those receiving shaves or haircuts might be of higher social standing, highlighting the disparity between service providers and recipients. This reflects the broader social structure where occupation and status were largely predetermined.</p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology:</strong> In terms of biomedical content, one can infer the importance of hygiene in preventing diseases in such a hot, arid climate. Poor hygiene could lead to skin infections or parasitic infestations. Geographic and climatic conditions often determined the prevalence and types of diseases.</p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness:</strong> While the fresco primarily illustrates barbering, indirect references to practices that prevent skin and scalp issues are evident. Regular shaving might have helped prevent lice and other skin conditions exacerbated by heat and exposure.</p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment:</strong> Treatments for skin diseases in Ancient Egypt often involved the use of herbs, oils, and other natural materials. Barbers might have utilized antiseptic plant extracts and mineral oils to maintain skin health for their clients, though this is not explicitly detailed in the fresco.</p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness:</strong> The depiction reflects a society where social class affected access to grooming and, by extension, health care. Wealthier individuals had more access to hygiene practices, thus reducing their exposure to certain diseases compared to poorer citizens.</p>
