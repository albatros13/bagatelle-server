        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork often identified within the context of early Persian medical illustrations is attributed to anonymous artists working during the Islamic Golden Age. These artists were influenced by a blend of Greek, Roman, and Islamic medical knowledge, creating visual depictions to accompany the texts of prominent physicians like Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Al-Razi (Rhazes).</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The illustrations date back to the 9th to 13th centuries, a period marked by a flourishing of scientific inquiry and cultural vibrancy in the Islamic world. This era, known as the Islamic Golden Age, saw significant advancements in various disciplines, including medicine, under a culturally rich and scientifically inquisitive Islamic Caliphate.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The anatomical drawings from this period often intertwined scientific knowledge with artistic symbolism. The human body was depicted using abstract forms to symbolize various aspects of health and disease, while often incorporating spiritual and philosophical concepts such as the balance of humors and the influence of celestial bodies.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork demonstrates a clear and symmetrical arrangement, reflecting the medieval Islamic perspective on balance and harmony. The use of line and color, though minimalistic, serves to outline and highlight the critical anatomical features, providing clarity crucial for educational purposes.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Despite the advancements in medical knowledge, access to this information was largely limited to scholars and the elite within society. This disparity in knowledge reflected broader socio-economic divides, as the majority of the population remained reliant on traditional folk medicine.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The focus of these anatomical drawings was primarily educational, often illustrating the theoretical understanding of disease as influenced by humoral theory, which posited that health was governed by the balance of bodily fluids.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In these illustrations, signs of illness were portrayed through symbolic representations, such as discolored skin or distorted anatomy, to convey concepts of imbalance or obstruction related to the humors.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments during this time heavily relied on balancing the humors through dietary adjustments, herbal remedies, and various techniques like bloodletting. The illustrations were often accompanied by texts detailing these treatments.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The prevalence of certain diseases was largely influenced by environmental and lifestyle factors, such as sanitation, climate, and diet, all of which were notably impacted by one's socio-economic status and geographical location.</p>
