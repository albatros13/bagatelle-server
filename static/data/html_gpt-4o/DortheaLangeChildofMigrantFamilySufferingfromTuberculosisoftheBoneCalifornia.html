        <h2>Dorthea Lange - Child of Migrant Family Suffering from Tuberculosis of the Bone</h2>
        <h3>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Dorthea Lange was an influential American documentary photographer and photojournalist, best known for her impactful images of the Great Depression. Her work played a crucial role in shaping the face of documentary photography during the early to mid-20th century.</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>This photograph was taken during the Great Depression, a period of great economic hardship in the United States, particularly from 1929 to the late 1930s. Migrant families, often displaced by the Dust Bowl, traveled across the country in search of work and better living conditions, facing numerous challenges along the way.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The image captures the raw human suffering and resilience of displaced families. The crutches used by the child signify physical struggle and impairment, while the presence of the car hints at the transient nature of migrant life during this era. It symbolizes both the tools of survival and the burden of displacement.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>Lange's use of black and white imagery emphasizes the stark realities faced by migrant families. The composition, with the child leaning on crutches, draws the viewer's focus immediately to her plight. The use of natural lighting and deep shadows enhances the emotional depth of the scene.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The photograph illustrates the glaring social inequalities faced by migrant workers, highlighting issues such as inadequate medical care and poor living conditions. This reflects the broader societal neglect of vulnerable populations during economic crises.</p>
        
        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The image specifically refers to a child suffering from tuberculosis of the bone, a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, leading to pain, deformity, and disability in the affected area.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Visible signs in the photograph include the child's use of crutches, indicative of bone weakness or joint pain, and possibly deformity. These signs are consistent with musculoskeletal complications associated with skeletal tuberculosis.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>During the time this photograph was taken, treatment for tuberculosis was limited and often ineffective. Bed rest and surgery were common. The later discovery of antibiotics and more effective drug therapies significantly improved outcomes for tuberculosis patients.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The prevalence of tuberculosis among migrant families can be linked to poor living conditions, malnutrition, and inadequate healthcare access, exacerbating the risk and severity of the illness in impoverished communities.</p>
