        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This anatomical illustration is attributed to early European practitioners of medical science and art during the late medieval period. Such illustrations were often created by scholars and artists skilled in both fields in collaboration with physicians.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The image originates from the late 15th century, a period marked by a growing interest in human anatomy influenced by Renaissance humanism. During this time, advances in printing technology helped disseminate medical knowledge widely. Illustrations such as this were part of a larger movement to develop a systematic understanding of the human body.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The image presents an anatomical man or "Zodiac Man," a common motif in medieval medicine that links the human body to astrological signs. The complex network of lines and text serves as both a medical guide and a symbolic chart of cosmic influences on human health.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The illustration uses line work to delineate anatomical structures and is characterized by heavy use of text, serving both as explanation and visual element. The stylistic simplicity contrasts with the complexity of the information conveyed, embodying the Renaissance merging of art and science.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This artwork reflects the era's limited access to medical knowledge, primarily restricted to male scholars and practitioners. Women and common people were often excluded from such learning, reinforcing existing social hierarchies.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The diseases referenced in the illustration would be influenced by humoral theory, which posited that health was governed by the balance of bodily fluids. Etiological explanations were more closely tied to astrological and elemental theories than modern germ-based understandings.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The illustration may depict signs of diseases like humoral imbalance through symbolic representations, guiding physicians in diagnosis through the visible signs and symptoms as prescribed by astrological conjunctions.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments during the time were often bizarre by modern standards, involving bloodletting, herbal remedies, and diet adjustments to restore humoral balance. The Zodiac associations dictated timing for these treatments.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Illness was often linked to social status, with the poor living in conditions conducive to disease and lacking access to medical care. Astrology-related beliefs also influenced medical treatment choices and perceived susceptibilities to diseases.</p>
