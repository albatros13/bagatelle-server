        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h2>
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h3>
        <p>André Brouillet was a renowned French artist known for his academic style and penchant for capturing moments of social and medical significance. His painting, "Une leçon clinique à la Salpêtrière," is considered his masterpiece and remains a pivotal work in illustrating the intersection of clinical practice and art.</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h3>
        <p>The painting was created in 1887, during a period when neurology and psychiatry were burgeoning fields. The Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris was a central site for the study and treatment of neurological disorders, often attended by leading figures such as Dr. Jean-Martin Charcot, depicted in the artwork. This era was pivotal in laying the groundwork for modern psychological and neurological treatments.</p>
        
        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The painting is symbolic of the transition in medical practice from mystical explanations of disease to scientific investigation. Charcot's presence signifies the authority of emerging medical science, while the patient's posture and expression symbolize vulnerability and the then-misunderstood nature of neurological disorders.</p>
        
        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>Brouillet employs a realistic style with a focus on detail, using light and shadow to draw attention to Charcot and the central figure of the patient. The composition is balanced, with figures arranged to create a sense of depth and focus, highlighting the drama of the clinical lesson unfolding.</p>
        
        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The artwork reflects the gender biases of the time, as many patients in neurological wards were women, often labeled as "hysterical." The medical interpretation of such conditions was heavily gendered and reflective of societal attitudes towards women's health and autonomy.</p>
        
        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The patient in the painting is likely experiencing what was then called "hysteria," a catch-all term used to describe a variety of psychological and neurological complaints. Today, conditions depicted would be more accurately diagnosed as conversion disorders or related neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>
        
        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Symptoms presented in the painting—such as fainting, muscular spasms, and immobilization—were often interpreted through the lens of hysteria, a diagnosis predominantly applied to women and influenced by psychiatric theories of the time, particularly those espoused by Charcot.</p>
        
        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment in the late 19th century often included hypnosis and suggestion, both techniques favored by Charcot. Over time, approaches evolved to include medications and the foundational principles of modern psychotherapy to address underlying psychological factors.</p>
        
        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The prevalence of hysteria diagnoses among women reflects broader social determinants such as gendered power dynamics, educational limitations, and economic dependence, which influenced both the experience and classification of illness.</p>
