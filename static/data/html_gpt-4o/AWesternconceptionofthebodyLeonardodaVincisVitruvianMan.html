        <h1>Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man</h1>
        <h2>a. Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Leonardo da Vinci, a polymath of the Renaissance era, is the creator of the Vitruvian Man. His vast skills spanned across various disciplines including art, science, engineering, and anatomy.</p>

        <h2>b. Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The Vitruvian Man was created around 1490 during the height of the Italian Renaissance, a period marked by a resurgence of interest in classical philosophy, literature, and art. This era emphasized the harmonization of artistic expression and scientific inquiry.</p>

        <h2>c. Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The Vitruvian Man symbolizes the blend of science and art during the Renaissance. The superimposed positions of the arms and legs relate to the ideas of Vitruvius, an ancient Roman architect who explored ideal human proportions.</p>

        <h2>d. Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Da Vinci's drawing exhibits a meticulous balance of line and form. The geometric accuracy and proportional perfection are testament to da Vinci's expertise in applying mathematical principles to achieve aesthetic harmony.</p>

        <h2>e. Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Although the Renaissance celebrated human potential, it primarily focused on the accomplishments of European males while overlooking contributions from other cultures and gender identities, perpetuating existing social inequities.</p>

        <h2>f. Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While the Vitruvian Man itself does not depict disease, its understanding of anatomy was pivotal in furthering biomedical knowledge, eventually informing the study of various diseases based on human anatomy.</p>

        <h2>g. Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Da Vinci's drawings later in life included studies that showed an early understanding of signs of illness, such as his sketches of the fetus and anatomy studies that hinted at insights into the inner workings of the human body.</p>

        <h2>h. Treatment</h2>
        <p>Renaissance medicine was beginning to evolve with figures like da Vinci leading the way in understanding the human body and its functions. Although treatments in his time were rudimentary, his anatomical studies laid groundwork for modern medicine.</p>

        <h2>i. Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>During the Renaissance, social determinants like class and education significantly influenced health outcomes. Access to medical knowledge was largely confined to elite groups, perpetuating disparities in health and treatment access.</p>
