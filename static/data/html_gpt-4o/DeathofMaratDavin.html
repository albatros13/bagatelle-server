        <h1>Death of Marat Davin</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork titled "Death of Marat Davin" draws inspiration from the famous painting "The Death of Marat" by Jacques-Louis David. David, a prominent French Neoclassical painter, profoundly influenced the direction of modern art with his historical and political themes, characteristic of the Enlightenment era.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The original artwork was completed in 1793 during the French Revolution, a period marked by immense social and political upheaval. This era focused on the Enlightenment ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity, as the revolutionaries sought to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting symbolizes the martyrdom of Jean-Paul Marat, a radical journalist and politician during the revolution. Depicted in a bath where he spent much of his time due to a debilitating skin condition, Marat’s letter held in hand symbolizes his unwavering dedication to the revolutionary cause, echoing religious martyrdom iconography.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The composition reflects Neoclassicism’s clarity, moral rectitude, and structured form. The use of light and shadow emphasizes Marat's serene expression and the stark realism highlights the moral solemnity. David's work is rooted in the principles of balance and proportion, embodying the Enlightenment’s call for reasoned thought.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Marat himself was a controversial figure whose writings often incited violence. The painting, while capturing the nobility and sacrifice, also underscores the tensions and inequities of the revolution, where new power structures fought over ideals, often leaving ordinary citizens caught in the crossfire of political conflicts.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Marat suffered from a severe skin condition, historically believed to be a form of dermatitis or eczema possibly exacerbated by stress and unsanitary conditions. This ailment confined him to medicinal baths, which serve as the setting for his assassination.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The depiction of Marat in the bath highlights the chronic nature of his skin disease. The image discreetly communicates signs of illness such as the visible lesions on his arms, reinforcing his physical vulnerability even as he maintained his fiery political presence.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Marat's time, treatment for skin conditions involved the use of herbal remedies and immersion in therapeutic waters. These ancient methods, while providing some relief, were limited in their efficacy due to the poor understanding of dermatological diseases at that time.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The cramped and unsanitary living conditions of revolutionary Paris likely aggravated Marat's condition. The stress and relentless nature of his political activities possibly hastened the deterioration of his health, signifying the broader interplay of environmental and social factors in the progression of illness.</p>
