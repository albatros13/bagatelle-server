        <h1>Dalton Diseased Penis: An Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork "Dalton Diseased Penis" emanates from an anonymous medical illustrator possibly associated with the 19th-century medical community. Such illustrations are often uncredited as they were created primarily for scientific documentation and not for artistic fame. These illustrators were highly skilled, possessing an in-depth understanding of both art and anatomy.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This illustration likely dates back to the late 1800s, a time when medical illustration was crucial for the documentation of disease before the advent of modern photography. The period was marked by immense advancements in medical science, yet there existed significant gaps in understanding diseases, especially those related to sexual health due to social taboos.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The illustration serves as a visual representation of a diseased state, emphasizing scientific clarity over artistic symbolism. It bridges the gap between visual art and medical science, using detailed anatomical accuracy to communicate conditions that were seldom discussed openly.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Characteristic of medical illustrations of the time, this piece utilizes realistic representation and precise detailing, focusing on texture and form to accurately portray the pathology. The application of muted color tones reflects the seriousness of the subject, while the strong emphasis on line quality enhances anatomical clarity.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>In the historical context, sexually transmitted infections were heavily stigmatized and often associated with moral failure. Such societal views restricted open discussion and treatment options, particularly affecting marginalized communities with limited access to healthcare and education.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The disease depicted is likely a sexually transmitted infection, such as syphilis, characterized by lesions and skin changes. Syphilis is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It is primarily spread through sexual contact, though congenital transmission can also occur.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The image displays typical signs of syphilitic infection: ulcerative lesions, rashes, and lesions. These physical manifestations are critical for diagnosis during the secondary stage of syphilis when skin changes are most apparent.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the 19th century, treatment options for syphilis were limited and often dangerous, with mercury being a common but toxic remedy. Today, syphilis is effectively treated with antibiotics, with penicillin being the most commonly used medication.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social determinants such as poverty, limited educational opportunities, and restricted access to healthcare significantly contribute to the prevalence and transmission of sexually transmitted infections. Stigma and lack of public health information further exacerbate these issues, highlighting the need for societal change.</p>
