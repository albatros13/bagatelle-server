        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h3>
        <p>The photograph is a work of Charles Eisenmann, a notable photographer in the late 19th century, known for capturing images of performers and individuals associated with the sideshow and entertainment industry. Eisenmann was active in New York, where his studio became a prominent fixture on Bowery Street.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>Captured in 1880, this photograph emerges during a time when the American society was enthralled by the novelty and spectacle of the "freak shows." These shows featured individuals with extraordinary physical attributes, and were rooted deeply in the social fabric of post-Civil War America, reflecting the era's fascination with differences and the "exotic" other.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
        <p>The image portrays an individual in a decorated setting, perhaps to emphasize the person’s unique appearance or condition. The use of props and clothing in Eisenmann’s works often highlighted the peculiarities of the subjects to enhance their allure in the entertainment circuit.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>Eisenmann’s photography is characterized by its clarity and directness. By utilizing the principles of contrast and focal emphasis, the artist centered on showcasing the distinct features of his subjects. The sepia tones and formal compositions lend an artistic gravity that intersects documentation and artistry.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>This photograph reflects the period's complex dynamics concerning race, class, and physical normalcy. Individuals displayed in such sideshows were often marginalized, commodified for their peculiarities, and their circumstances were exploited for entertainment purposes, raising questions about consent and dignity.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The photograph possibly depicts an individual with a medical condition affecting physical appearance, such as obesity. In the 19th century, medical understanding of obesity was limited, often associated with laziness or gluttony rather than a nuanced understanding of metabolic or genetic factors.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Visible manifestations in the photograph that could be indicative of medical conditions include excessive body weight. In a modern medical context, such signs are assessed alongside other factors to diagnose conditions like metabolic syndrome or hormonal imbalances.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>In the 19th century, treatments for obesity were rudimentary and often harsh, focusing on restrictive diets. Modern treatments have evolved to include lifestyle interventions, medications, and in some cases, surgical interventions aimed at managing underlying causes as well as psychological support.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Social determinants such as socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and education significantly impact the prevalence and management of obesity. Historical inequities also contribute to stigmatization and marginalization of individuals based on body size and health status.</p>
