        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis of "John of Austria's Presentation to Emperor Charles V at Yuste" by Eduardo Rosales</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Eduardo Rosales is recognized as a significant figure in the 19th-century Spanish art scene. Trained in the academic style, Rosales is known for his historical paintings which often depicted pivotal moments in Spanish history. His works are characterized by meticulous attention to detail and a commitment to historical accuracy.</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>Painted in 1869, the artwork reflects the era's fascination with historical narratives and realism. It showcases the presentation of John of Austria to Emperor Charles V. This period in Spain was marked by political instability and a revival of interest in historical subjects as a way to explore and reflect on national identity.</p>
        
        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The painting uses rich symbols rooted in political and personal power. Charles V’s portrayal in a seated position highlights his status and kingship, while the attentive figures around him symbolize loyalty and respect. The solemnity of the scene underscores the weight of political duty.</p>
        
        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>Rosales utilizes a muted color palette to convey the seriousness of the scene, with intricate details emphasizing the opulence of the royal court. The composition directs the viewer's focus to Charles V, creating a focal point and utilizing symmetry to enhance balance and harmony in the scene.</p>
        
        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The artwork indirectly comments on the hierarchical nature of monarchies, presenting a world where power is concentrated in the hands of a few. It reflects the era's rigid social strata, where privilege was often aligned with nobility, and common people rarely had a voice in governance.</p>
        
        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The painting depicts Emperor Charles V, who historically suffered from gout. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint. Historically, it was associated with indulgence in rich foods and alcoholic beverages.</p>
        
        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The artwork subtly incorporates signs of Charles V's affliction, such as his seated posture and the subdued colors that frame his figure, suggesting a sense of affliction or discomfort. This reflects the historical narrative of his suffering from chronic pain due to gout.</p>
        
        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>During the 16th century, treatments for gout were rudimentary and often involved dietary restrictions. Rest and herbal remedies were common, though their efficacy was limited. The depiction of Charles V might also symbolically represent the helplessness often felt due to the condition's recurring nature.</p>
        
        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Gout was historically known as the "disease of kings" due to its association with affluence and excess consumption of rich foods and alcohol, highlighting the role of lifestyle in health. It serves as a reminder of how socio-economic factors can influence disease prevalence and impact.</p>
