        <h2>Gentile da Fabriano's Presentation at the Temple (1423)</h2>
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Gentile da Fabriano was an Italian painter who was part of the International Gothic style. He was known for his elaborate and detailed works, often commissioned by wealthy patrons. His artistry stood at the cusp of the transition from medieval to Renaissance styles, blending ornate detail with evolving linear perspectives.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>Created in 1423, this artwork reflects the religious and cultural contexts of early 15th-century Italy. The period was marked by a strong influence of religious orthodoxy, with art serving as a vehicle for spiritual expression and for depicting biblical narratives. It was a time of significant economic growth and patronage from the wealthy merchant classes, which facilitated advancements in art.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The Presentation at the Temple is laden with religious symbolism. The scene depicts the Virgin Mary presenting Jesus at the Temple, an event described in the Gospel according to Luke. The halos signify holiness, while the intricate architectural space represents divine order and spiritual structure. The presence of aged prophets holding the infant Christ signifies the fulfillment of divine prophecy.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>The artwork is distinguished by its use of rich color, meticulous detail, and a sense of depth achieved through architectural elements. Fabriano employed gilt highlights to convey a divine light. This combines with a balanced composition and the use of hierarchy of scale to focus the viewer’s attention on central religious figures.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The painting subtly hints at social hierarchies of the time. Characters are depicted in fine robes suggesting wealth, while the humble setting for the temple rituals underscores disparities between divine events and common life. This reflects the societal structure where class distinctions were clear and prominently featured in religious and artistic narratives.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>While not overtly biomedical, some figures exhibit physical characteristics that can be analyzed medically. The figure on the right holding a cane may represent aging or disease, typical of many 15th-century artistic depictions aiming to represent the universality of human frailty.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The presence of withered features and use of walking aids in some figures can indicate ailments such as arthritis or age-related debility, which were prevalent among the aging, depicting the limitations of medieval medicine in addressing chronic conditions.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>In the 15th century, treatments for conditions such as arthritis were rudimentary and involved herbal remedies and physiotherapy-like exercise. Advanced medical care was limited and often intertwined with spiritual or religious interventions.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The limited medical understanding and the skewed distribution of healthcare to the affluent meant that social standing greatly influenced health outcomes. The access to treatment was significantly varied across different social classes, contributing to differing life expectancies and quality of life.</p>
