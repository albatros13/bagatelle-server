        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The "Wound Man" illustration is a widely recognized yet anonymous medieval artwork, often attributed to various artists and regions within Europe due to its numerous reproductions. It is a schematic diagram found in medical manuscripts used to teach the practices of surgery and medicine. Although specific artists are usually unknown, it was influenced by the knowledge of medieval physicians and travelers, capturing a blend of medical understanding across different cultures.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The image, estimated to originate around the 14th century, reflects the late medieval period's practices. This was a time when anatomical knowledge was advancing slowly, hindered by religious and societal prohibitions against dissection. It was a period marked by the Black Death and warfare that shaped the demand for medical advancements. "Wound Man" served as a pragmatic educational tool illustrating injuries commonly encountered in battle and the necessary medical interventions.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The image depicts a human figure punctuated by various weapons and objects, symbolically representing different injuries and treatments. Each wound is connected to a brief explanatory note, a guide for physicians to understand symptoms and remedies. This iconography underscores the intersection of art and science, utilizing visualization to communicate complex medical conditions concisely.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The "Wound Man" is designed with a pragmatic approach, characterized by linear forms and minimalistic details. The lack of perspective and proportion focuses attention on the medical content rather than artistic finesse. The distribution of objects around the body uses radial balance, emphasizing the centrality of the human figure and ensuring each part of the image conveys useful information uniformly.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The period in which "Wound Man" was created lacked advanced medical care accessible to all, with medicine predominantly available to the affluent classes or those involved in combat. This imagery reflects a society where health services were disparate, highlighting class distinctions in access to medical knowledge and treatment.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The etiology depicted encompasses a variety of physical traumas, primarily lacerations, punctures, and penetrating wounds incurred during battles. The image serves as both a visual account and a medical text, illustrating common injuries that were a direct result of warfare artifacts like arrows and swords, alongside potential infections.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The signs represented include visible wounds marked by blood and the depiction of various embedded objects. The aim was to educate practitioners on recognizing trauma and understanding the necessary procedures for each type of injury, from suturing to amputation.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments derived from the medieval understanding of medicine, including suturing, cauterization, and the use of herbal remedies for pain and infection management. Each depicted weapon or injury signifies the type of intervention required, serving as a visual guide for early medical practitioners.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social factors such as warfare, the economy, and prevalent diseases shaped the medical landscape. The pressures of conflict necessitated advancements in understanding trauma, while economic conditions influenced access to care, showcasing how medical practice was intertwined with broader societal frameworks.</p>
