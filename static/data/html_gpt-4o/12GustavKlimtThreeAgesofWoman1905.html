        <h1>Gustav Klimt - Three Ages of Woman (1905)</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            Gustav Klimt, an Austrian symbolist painter, is known for his evocative work which often explored themes of femininity, life, and death. As a leading member of the Vienna Secession movement, Klimt's works are characterized by their ornate, decorative style and bold visual metaphors.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>
            "Three Ages of Woman" was completed in 1905, during a period marked by rapid industrialization, modernization, and socio-political change in Europe. Influenced by Art Nouveau, Klimt's work reflected the changing attitudes toward gender and the role of women in society at the turn of the 20th century. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>
            This artwork presents a symbolic representation of the stages of a woman's life—youth, motherhood, and old age—encompassed within the same frame. The use of intricate patterns and gold leaf is emblematic of life's richness and complexity. Klimt employs iconography that juxtaposes beauty and decay, capturing the inevitable passage of time.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>
            Klimt's style in this piece is notable for its intricate patterns and vibrant colors, which draw on Byzantine and Japanese art. The interplay of two-dimensional patterns with three-dimensional figures creates a compelling visual rhythm. Klimt's use of gold leaf not only emphasizes his decorative technique but also communicates transcendence and ethereal beauty.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            Through the "Three Ages of Woman," Klimt subtly addresses the societal pressures imposed on women, especially concerning aging and beauty. The contrast between the tender depiction of youth and harsh lines of age highlights ageism and the undervaluing of older women within his contemporary culture.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            While this artwork does not directly depict a disease, the representation of aging can be linked to an exploration of human mortality and the frailty associated with age-related illnesses such as osteoporosis or Alzheimer’s disease.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            The portrayal of the older woman, with her stooped posture and withdrawn demeanor, can signify physical decline and the burden of age-associated diseases. The sagging skin and somber expression are artistic representations of the impact of aging on the human condition.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            At the time the painting was created, treatments for aging-related conditions were rudimentary at best. Care often focused on symptomatic relief rather than cure, reflecting the limited medical understanding of such diseases. Social treatment often marginalized older women, relegating them to the peripheries of family and society.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Factors such as socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and prevailing cultural narratives around aging influenced individuals’ experiences of aging and illness. The depiction in Klimt’s painting underscores these conditions by visualizing the isolation and vulnerability often faced by older women due to societal neglect and lack of supportive infrastructure.
