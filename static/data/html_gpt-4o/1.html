        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork under discussion originates from the Tibetan medical tradition. This illustration is part of a series illustrating the ancient text known as the "Blue Beryl," which is a commentary on the "Four Tantras," an essential text in Tibetan medicine. The artist or illustrator remains unknown, typical of many traditional Tibetan works where the emphasis is on the medical knowledge rather than individual authorship.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>Originating in the 17th century, this work represents a period when Tibetan medicine was becoming an integrated fusion of various influences, including Indian Ayurvedic traditions, Chinese practices, and indigenous Tibetan beliefs. During this time, medical knowledge was not only health-focused but also deeply connected to spirituality and religious practices.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
        <p>The artwork is rich in symbolism, portraying the human body as an interconnected system of channels and winds. The red lines represent the rong veins, showing how energy and essence circulate. The colors and forms are symbolic of elements in traditional Tibetan medicine, conveying how physical and spiritual health is interconnected.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>The artwork employs vibrant colors and stylized forms to convey its medical message, following traditional painting techniques. The flat application of color, stylized anatomy, and absence of spatial depth reflect the symbolic rather than the literal representation, focusing instead on imparting complex medical ideas through simple, understandable forms.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Tibetan medical texts were traditionally accessible primarily to monks and practitioners within monastic settings, reflecting a disparity in access to healthcare knowledge. This limitation meant that those outside religious institutions, especially among lay populations, had indirect benefits from medical practices depicted in such illustrations.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The medical illustration encapsulates a holistic view of diseases, emphasizing an imbalance of energies or humors within the body, according to Tibetan medicine. Diseases were seen as resulting from both internal imbalances and external lifestyle factors, aligned with the teachings of balancing the body's three doshas: wind, bile, and phlegm.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The signs of illness in this work are depicted abstractly through blocked or excessive flow in the depicted channels. This highlights the belief that diseases manifest when these life forces are not in harmony, evident in how the pathways and nodes are illustrated in a state of imbalance.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatments in this tradition often involved a combination of herbal medicines, dietary changes, and spiritual or meditative practices. The illustration facilitates the understanding of how treatments might affect energy flow and the importance of addressing both physical and spiritual health for healing.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Tibetan medicine places significant emphasis on how lifestyle, environment, and mental state contribute to health or illness, resonating with modern understandings of social determinants of health. The artwork's depictions suggest that achieving equilibrium between one's environment and internal psychology is crucial for good health.</p>
