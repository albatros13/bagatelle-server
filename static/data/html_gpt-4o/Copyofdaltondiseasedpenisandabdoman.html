        <h2>Dalton Diseased Penis and Abdomen</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork in question appears to be a medical illustration attributed to the artist Dalton, likely created for educational or illustrative purposes. The name does not align directly with a known contemporary artist but rather suggests the illustration was for specialized medical analysis, probably produced by a trained illustrator or medical practitioner focused on anatomical accuracy.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>This illustration possibly dates back to the 18th or 19th century when documenting diseases through medical illustrations was a common practice. This period saw a rise in the empirical study of human anatomy and pathology, influenced by the Enlightenment and post-Renaissance emphasis on scientific inquiry and detailed observation.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The illustration doesn't exhibit traditional symbolism or iconography associated with fine art but rather serves a functional symbolic role by vividly representing pathological symptoms. This type of work would have been used to educate medical students about specific diseases, helping bridge the gap between observation and understanding of medical conditions.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>In terms of artistic style, the illustration uses realism and detailed representation typical of medical illustrations from this era. The focus is on clarity and precision, employing elements like color contrast and shading to highlight pathological features—consistent with the design of informative medical textbooks.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Throughout history, those affected by visible diseases often faced significant social stigma and inequities. This illustration reflects the period's attempt to scientifically approach ailments that were sometimes misunderstood and mythologized. The educational use of such depictions also underscores the socio-cultural shift towards destigmatizing physical conditions through education.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>This artwork appears to depict an advanced state of a sexually transmitted disease, most likely syphilis, given the depiction of lesions. During the 18th and 19th centuries, syphilis was rampant across Europe and America, with its etiology linked to the bacterium <em>Treponema pallidum</em>.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The illustration highlights common pathological signs of syphilis during its tertiary stage, including gummatous ulcers on genitalia and skin, indicative of severe systemic infection. Visual depictions like this played a crucial role in diagnosing external symptoms before the advent of advanced imaging technologies.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment during the time involved the use of mercury and other rudimentary remedies. These were of limited effect and often accompanied by severe side effects. It wasn't until the early 20th century that penicillin became the go-to treatment, leading to a significant decrease in syphilitic cases.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>During the time of this illustration's creation, factors such as poverty, lack of education, and limited access to healthcare exacerbated the spread and impact of syphilis. These determinants contributed to the higher prevalence of disease in specific socioeconomic classes.</p>
