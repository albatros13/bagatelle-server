        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        The artwork depicted in the attached image comes from renowned artists of different eras. Edvard Munch, Rembrandt, and Hans Holbein the Younger contributed significantly to art history, each bringing unique perspectives and styles to their work. These artists have illustrated aspects of life, health, and society through their groundbreaking approaches.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        Each artwork emerges from a distinct historical context. Munch's "The Inheritance," painted in 1897, reflects the fin de siècle concerns with heredity and degeneration. Rembrandt's "Portrait of de Lairesse," painted in the 17th century, gives insight into the human experience and societal attitudes towards illness in the Dutch Golden Age. Holbein's "Head of a Young Man" epitomizes the German Renaissance's intricate realism and sobering concerns with mortality. Each artwork provides a window into the socio-cultural landscape and medical understanding of its time.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        These artworks depict congenital syphilis, a condition loaded with cultural and symbolic associations through history. In Munch's painting, the vulnerable bond between mother and child is visually unsettling, symbolizing not only a tragic inheritance of disease but also broader tensions of the late 19th century. Rembrandt often used shadow and light to symbolize deeper truths and moral queries, with the figure’s expression evoking the harsh social ramifications of visible illness. Holbein’s precision and attention to human vulnerability implicitly criticize and illuminate the insidiousness of disease.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        Edvard Munch's expressionistic style presents raw emotional content through color and form, pushing the viewer to engage with profound human conditions. Rembrandt’s mastery in chiaroscuro enhances emotional depth and contemplation, a hallmark of Baroque art. Holbein’s realistic portrayal echoes the Renaissance fascination with anatomical precision, encouraging viewers to ponder the intricacies and impermanence of life.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        These artworks underscore how disease magnifies social inequities. Conditions like syphilis disproportionately affected marginalized populations, revealing failures in health systems and societal empathy. Each piece thus raises questions about societal complicity in the stigmatization and neglect of those afflicted.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        Syphilis is a chronic bacterial infection caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum. Congenital syphilis occurs when the bacteria is transmitted from a pregnant mother to her fetus, resulting in deformities and significant infant mortality if untreated.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        Congenital syphilis is marked by a variety of clinical signs, such as rash, fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and characteristic facial deformities seen in these artworks. The facial disfigurement illustrated in these artistic pieces echoes the stigma and isolation faced by those with visible manifestations of this disease.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        In the past, treatments for syphilis were rudimentary and often toxic, such as mercury and later arsenic-based remedies. The discovery of penicillin in the 20th century provided an effective treatment, drastically reducing the prevalence of syphilis and congenital syphilis when administered appropriately.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Poverty, limited access to healthcare, and social stigma are crucial determinants influencing the spread and management of congenital syphilis historically and currently. These factors hinder timely diagnosis and treatment, perpetuating cycles of health disparities.
