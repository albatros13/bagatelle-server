        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork is attributed to medieval European illustrators and is part of a larger compendium on medical practices that integrated astrological influences with human health. The creators were often anonymous monk-scribes or commissioned artists with expertise in both art and science.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h3>
        <p>This piece originates from the medieval period, a time when science and mysticism intertwined. The artwork reflects the era’s belief that human health was influenced by celestial bodies, a concept that was prevalent from the 12th to the 15th centuries.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The diagram illustrates the 'Zodiac Man,' a common motif in medieval medicine linking different body parts to astrological signs. Each section of the body is connected to a zodiac symbol, illustrating the influence of astrology on physiological and psychological health.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>The artwork uses linear elements to connect body parts to zodiac symbols arranged in a circular format, emphasizing the cyclical nature of the zodiac calendar. The use of color, primarily earthy tones, underscores the organic connection between body and celestial forces.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Access to such manuscripts was limited to the educated elites, usually clerics and physicians. This restricted medical knowledge to a select few, reinforcing existing socio-cultural hierarchies and limiting broader public understanding of health and disease.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The artwork does not depict a specific disease but instead presents a system for understanding the human body concerning cosmic influences. However, medieval medical texts often linked celestial phenomena to conditions like epilepsy and mental disturbances.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The illustration reflects the belief that astrological signs could manifest as physical ailments when specific body parts were affected by imbalanced humors or adverse planetary alignments. This belief system attributed various diseases to cosmic influences.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatments influenced by this belief system often included herbal remedies, bloodletting, and aligning medical interventions with astrological calendars to optimize healing, despite the lack of empirical efficacy by modern standards.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The artwork illustrates an understanding of health predicated on external, cosmic forces rather than internal physiological factors, suggesting that environmental and cosmological determinants were paramount. This reflects the socio-cultural context where mystical interpretations of disease were commonplace.</p>
