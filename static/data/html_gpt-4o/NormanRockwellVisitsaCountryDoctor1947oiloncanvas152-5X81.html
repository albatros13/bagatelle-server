            <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
            <p>Painted shortly after World War II, this artwork belongs to a period when America was transitioning into a new era of prosperity. The 1940s witnessed significant developments in medicine, but access to healthcare was still limited in rural areas, a reality captured in Rockwell's painting.</p>

            <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h3>
            <p>Rockwell’s use of iconography is evident in the homey, warm setting of the doctor's office. The tools and paraphernalia placed around the room symbolize the doctor's trade and dedication. The young child's presence may symbolize hope and continuity, suggesting the importance of caring for the next generation.</p>

            <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
            <p>The use of realistic style and meticulous attention to detail are hallmarks of Rockwell's work. His choice to render the scene in rich, warm colors helps create a comforting atmosphere. The composition guides the viewer's eye around the room, emphasizing the interaction between the doctor and patients.</p>

            <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
            <p>Despite its warmth, the painting subtly comments on healthcare inequities. In the 1940s, rural communities often lacked medical facilities and practitioners. Rockwell portrays a family relying on a general practitioner, alluding to the broader challenges in accessing healthcare in such regions.</p>

            <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
            <p>While the painting does not specify a disease, it does suggest a common cold or another minor illness given the child's presence in the doctor's office. Such illnesses were typical reasons for visiting a country doctor, who often addressed various health needs due to limited specialized care.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
            <p>The patient's appearance and home setting reflect socio-economic factors influencing health, such as access to nutritious food, education, and clean living conditions. It illustrates the social determinants affecting the family's ability to maintain good health.</p>
