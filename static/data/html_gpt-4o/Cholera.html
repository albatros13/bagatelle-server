        <h2>Cholera: An Intersection of Art and Science</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artist behind this lithograph depicting a cholera victim is unknown. The artwork was intended for informational and educational purposes during cholera epidemics in the 19th century, possibly produced by a medical professional or illustrator skilled in anatomical drawings.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h3>
        <p>This artwork originates from the 19th century, a period marked by frequent cholera outbreaks across the globe. The first pandemic began in 1817, and by 1832 the disease had reached Europe and North America. During this period, medical illustrations were critical for educating healthcare workers and the public about this mysterious and deadly disease.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The image symbolizes the severe impact of cholera on the human body. The depiction of the victim lying on a simple mattress reinforces the harsh realities of the pandemic, focusing on the helplessness and universal vulnerability that characterized cholera outbreaks.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance</h3>
        <p>The lithograph employs elements such as line and contrast to emphasize the subject's lifelessness. The use of stark lines and shading draws attention to the skeletal appearance of the victim, a common symptom of cholera due to rapid dehydration.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Cholera epidemics disproportionately affected poorer communities who lacked access to clean water and adequate sanitation. The artwork may imply these inequities, as the depicted setting appears devoid of comfort or medical care, underscoring the critical social determinants of health prevalent during the time.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. People can contract the disease through consuming contaminated water or food. It is prevalent in regions with inadequate water treatment, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>In the illustration, the victim's emaciated frame, sunken eyes, and pallor signify severe dehydration and shock, common signs of cholera. These symptoms arise from rapid loss of fluids due to diarrhea and vomiting, which can lead to death within hours if untreated.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment of cholera primarily involves prompt rehydration, using oral rehydration solutions or intravenous fluids in severe cases. Antibiotics may reduce the duration and severity of illness, and the introduction of cholera vaccines has become an integral part of prevention strategies.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Social determinants such as poverty, inadequate housing, and lack of access to clean water contribute significantly to the spread of cholera. These factors highlight the importance of addressing socio-economic conditions to prevent outbreaks and improve public health outcomes.</p>
