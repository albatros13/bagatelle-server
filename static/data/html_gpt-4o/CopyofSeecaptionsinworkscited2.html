        <h2>The Triumph of Bacchus (Los Borrachos)</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork "The Triumph of Bacchus" or "Los Borrachos" was painted by the renowned Spanish artist Diego Velázquez. Velázquez was a leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age and served as the court painter to King Philip IV.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h3>
        <p>Created in 1629, during the Baroque period, this painting reflects the socio-political dynamics of 17th-century Spain. The era was marked by economic challenges and societal contrasts, visible in Velázquez's works, which often depicted multi-faceted interpretations of power and festivity.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The painting represents Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, as he crowns a drunkard with a wreath of vines. This gathering symbolizes the temporary escape of ordinary life through intoxication. The juxtaposition of a deity among common men highlights the unity in celebration but also hints at indulgence's ephemeral nature.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>Velázquez utilized chiaroscuro to bring depth and dimension, accentuating the human figures against a muted background. The composition employs dynamic diagonal lines, creating movement and guiding the viewer's eye through the scene's narrative. The earthy palette reflects the realism and rawness intrinsic to the Baroque style.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>While this painting celebrates Bacchic rites, it subtly critiques the disparity between societal classes. The presence of commoners in the company of a god underscores their longing for divine or regal experiences otherwise reserved for the elite.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>One of the figures exhibits signs of Rhinophyma, a condition often linked to severe rosacea, characterized by an enlarged, bulbous red nose. Historically, Rhinophyma was mistakenly attributed to alcohol consumption, dubbed “drinker’s nose.” It’s now recognized as a subtype of rosacea with unclear etiology, although genetic and environmental factors might contribute.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Rhinophyma manifests through hypertrophy of sebaceous glands in the nose, leading to thickening and disfiguration. In historical art, its presence was often used to portray excessive consumption and moral failing due to its visual association with stereotypical drunkenness.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment of Rhinophyma has evolved from rudimentary surgeries depicted historically to advanced laser therapies and medications. Modern interventions focus on aesthetic restoration and managing underlying rosacea through a combination of pharmacological and surgical approaches.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The portrayal of Rhinophyma in Velázquez’s work highlights past misconceptions about alcoholism and its stigmatized health implications. Societal biases regarding lifestyle choices and health appearance influence perceptions of illness, reflecting broader inequities in health understanding across classes.</p>
