        <h1>Anathomia Muscle Man in Red and Black Back View</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The "Anathomia Muscle Man" is a notable illustration from the medieval manuscript known as "Anathomia," which was produced by dissection experts. Its creation is often attributed to that period's learned individuals who specialized in the intricate study of human anatomy rather than a named artist.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Dating back to the medieval era, anatomical illustrations like these played a crucial role in bridging emerging medical knowledge with the prevalent scientific paradigms. During this time, the understanding of human anatomy shifted from a medieval perspective, rooted in theological explanations, to one increasingly anchored in empirical study.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>This anatomical illustration showcases the human musculature, depicted in red and black. The colors signify the duality of life (red) and death or underlying structure (black), reflecting medieval perceptions of anatomy and biology. Such imagery symbolizes the human body as both a mystical and mechanistic entity.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Stylistically, this artwork manifests the medieval manuscript tradition, with a focus on linear precision and clarity of illustration. The use of color coding—red for muscles, and black for outlines—conveys anatomical information effectively. The symmetrical balance in the composition emphasizes the educational purpose of the piece.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Access to anatomical knowledge during the medieval period was predominantly limited to scholars and clergy, reflecting the period's social and cultural hierarchies. This exclusivity meant that only a select group had the opportunity to interpret and understand these illustrations fully, leading to inequities in medical knowledge dissemination.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While the illustration primarily serves as an anatomical study, its educational purpose indirectly correlates to the understanding of diseases affecting the musculature. Infections or inflammatory conditions affecting muscular function would have been common subjects of study in this context.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The detailed display of muscles might have been used to understand conditions like muscle atrophy or inflammation. The depiction aids in recognizing deviations from healthy muscles' structural integrity, providing a foundation for diagnosing musculoskeletal ailments.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In medieval times, treatments for muscular diseases would have been rudimentary, often involving herbal remedies or early surgical interventions, which were guided by such anatomical studies. Understanding muscle anatomy was crucial for devising effective treatment modalities.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Socioeconomic factors, including class and occupation, significantly affected individuals' health, especially musculoskeletal conditions. Laborers were more prone to such ailments due to physically demanding tasks. This illustration reflects an educational leap towards addressing these determinants.</p>
