        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis of Medieval English Artwork</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        The artwork, produced anonymously, reflects the distinct visual culture of Medieval England. It emerged from a period where artist identities were often overshadowed by collective endeavors in monastic settings and the wider societal contribution to manuscripts.

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        Crafted during Medieval England, this piece reportedly dates back to the 13th or 14th century. This era was characterized by a rigid social structure and burgeoning religious art. It was a time of both theological exploration and tangible encounters with various human conditions.

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        The depicted figures symbolize social perceptions of disability and mental illness during the period. Each character embodies various conditions that were familiar yet poorly understood, such as lunacy, leprosy, and physical impairments, reflecting deep-seated societal views on misfortune and difference.

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        The artwork utilizes simplistic line work and earthy tones perilously matched with brighter accents, characteristic of manuscript illumination. The figures are animated and expressive, forming a dynamic representation through limited color palettes, emphasizing storytelling over realism.

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        Medieval society often marginalized individuals with disabilities, as captured in this artwork. These groups faced systemic inequities, underscoring a social hierarchy that allotted privilege primarily along lines of economic and physical status, with compassion tempered by ignorance.

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        The individuals illustrated here suffer from various conditions understood differently today. These could include leprosy and other infectious diseases, mental disorders, and congenital disabilities. The aetiological understanding in Medieval times linked such conditions to divine judgement or moral failings.

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        Visible signs such as deformities and unusual postures in the artwork signal the pathologies that marked social outsiders. The emphasis on physical and mental differences is stark, hinting at a limited comprehension of medical conditions beyond observable symptoms.

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        Treatments in Medieval England were rudimentary and largely ineffective by modern standards, integrating herbal remedies, spiritual interventions, and rudimentary forms of physical care. Such treatments were often intertwined with religious practices, reflecting a close association of health with spiritual well-being.

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        Social determinants, including poverty, lack of education, and limited healthcare, significantly impacted the lived experience of those depicted as ill or disabled. These elements underline an enduring legacy of inequality, maintained by systemic barriers to improvement and understanding.
