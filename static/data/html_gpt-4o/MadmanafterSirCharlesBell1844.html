        <h1>Madman after Sir Charles Bell (1844)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            This artwork is believed to be derived from the works of Sir Charles Bell, a renowned Scottish surgeon and anatomist. Bell was not only influential in the field of medicine but also in art, using anatomical drawings to advance scientific understanding.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            Created in 1844, during the height of the Industrial Revolution in England, this period witnessed significant changes in society, urbanization, and technological advancements. Within this context, mental illness began to receive more medical attention, although understanding and treatments were rudimentary by today's standards.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h2>
        <p>
            The image symbolically represents the marginalization of individuals with mental health conditions during the 19th century. The use of chains in the artwork emphasizes oppression and the lack of freedom for those suffering from mental illnesses, highlighting the attitudes of the time towards mental health.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            Stylistically, the artwork utilizes strong contrast and detailed line work to convey the intense emotion. There is a stark focus on the physical form of the individual, emphasizing the raw emotion and physicality associated with mental distress.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            The depiction reflects the socio-cultural inequities wherein those with mental illnesses were often isolated and mistreated. The lack of understanding led to stigmatization, and individuals were frequently confined in asylums under harsh conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            The artwork suggests a condition likely classified today under psychiatric disorders, perhaps schizophrenia or severe depression. At the time, mental illnesses were not well understood, often attributed to moral failings or supernatural causes.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            The physical representation - the huddled posture, distressed expression, and chains - signifies the severe impact of untreated mental illness, manifesting in behavior that was often perceived as dangerous or irrational during that era.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            In the 19th century, treatments for mental illness were limited and often inhumane. Methods included confinement, physical restraint, and sometimes experimental surgeries, reflecting the limited understanding and empathy of the time.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Factors such as poverty, lack of education, and inadequate healthcare access exacerbated mental health conditions. The socio-economic environment during this era provided little to no support for mental wellness, contributing to poorer outcomes.
