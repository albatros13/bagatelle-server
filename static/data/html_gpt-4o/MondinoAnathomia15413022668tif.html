        <h1>Mondino Anathomia (15413022668)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        Mondino dei Liuzzi, known as Mondino, was a prominent Italian physician and anatomist during the medieval period. His work, "Anathomia," published in 1316, significantly contributed to anatomical studies and education. Mondino's illustrations and analyses became foundational texts for medical students and practitioners in Europe.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        The creation of "Anathomia" occurred during the early Renaissance, a time characterized by a renewed interest in scientific inquiry and humanism. During the 14th century, medical practices were evolving from mysticism to more empirical-based approaches. The work of Mondino and his contemporaries was instrumental in shifting medical education towards observation and dissection.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        The illustration in Mondino’s "Anathomia" serves as more than a mere depiction of anatomy. It symbolizes the intersection of science and art during the Renaissance. The meticulous detail of the human body reflects the increasing importance placed on empirical observation and understanding of human anatomy, which marked a departure from reliance on ancient texts.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        Mondino's illustrations are characterized by their intricate line work and attention to detail, emphasizing clarity and educational utility. The design elements highlight the structure and function of the human body, showcasing balance, proportion, and symmetry, which were key principles in Renaissance art and science.

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        During Mondino's time, access to medical knowledge and resources was predominantly restricted to the elite. Social and cultural inequities determined who could pursue medical education and who had access to healthcare. This limited the dissemination of new knowledge to a broader public and reflected the broader societal hierarchies of the period.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        The anatomical focus of Mondino’s work does not directly address specific diseases but provides a foundational understanding of human anatomy essential for diagnosing and treating illnesses. The study of human anatomy was crucial in identifying pathological changes in the body, although detailed etiological theories were still developing.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        The anatomical illustrations in "Anathomia" helped physicians recognize deviations from normal anatomical structures, aiding in the identification of signs of illness. Knowledge of normal anatomy was pivotal in diagnosing conditions during and beyond Mondino's time.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        Medical treatments in the 14th century were transitioning from traditional herbal remedies to more scientific approaches. Although Mondino’s work provided anatomical knowledge, treatments for diseases remained varied, combining empirical findings with traditional practices until more scientific consensus emerged in later centuries.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        In Mondino's era, social determinants such as class, education, and occupation significantly impacted health outcomes. Poor hygiene and sanitation conditions and access to care were largely dictated by one’s social and economic status, affecting the prevalence and treatment of diseases.
