        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork, often recognized as a part of medieval medical manuscript illustrations, is attributed to anonymous artists working in monastic scriptoriums. These artists were typically monks or scribes devoted to the creation of medical and anatomical texts during the medieval period.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>This illustration is from the medieval period, specifically from the 14th or 15th century. This era was characterized by the intertwining of science and religion, with monastic communities playing a significant role in the preservation and advancement of medical knowledge. The European societies of this time relied heavily on classical texts, interpreted through the lens of Christian theology.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The illustration is rooted in medieval anatomical traditions and often depicts the human body as a cosmological entity. Each organ and structure is not only a physiological element but also a reflection of the divine order and the microcosm-macrocosm analogy prevalent in medieval thought.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>The artwork showcases distinct medieval styles: linear drawings with little emphasis on realistic proportions but rich in symbolic representation. The use of simplified lines and limited color palettes aligns with the aesthetic and material constraints of manuscript illumination.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Access to such texts and their illustrations was restricted to specific social classes, primarily clergy and scholars. The lay population lacked direct access to medical knowledge, thus reinforcing societal hierarchies and knowledge disparity.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The medieval understanding of diseases was limited and deeply intertwined with spiritual beliefs. Illnesses were often perceived as an imbalance of humors—blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile—or as divine punishment.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Anatomical illustrations attempted to depict internal structures to aid understanding of humoral imbalances. These images would symbolically indicate excess or deficiency in certain body areas correlating to particular symptoms or diseases.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatments were based on balancing the humors through methods such as bloodletting, purging, and the use of herbal remedies. These practices were guided by prevailing medical theories from antiquity, such as those of Galen.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Conditions such as poor sanitation, limited diet, and lack of medical infrastructure primarily affected lower social classes, contributing to higher morbidity and mortality. Medieval societies often viewed such suffering as natural or inevitable rather than preventable.</p>
