        <h2>Elephant Man</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The image known as the "Elephant Man" is a visual representation of Joseph Merrick, a man who lived in the late 19th century with severe physical deformities. While not produced by a notable artist, this artwork was likely created by a medical illustrator or an artist working in a clinical setting to document Merrick's condition for historical and educational purposes.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>Joseph Merrick, also known as the Elephant Man, lived during the Victorian era in England, a time characterized by industrial expansion, social reforms, and a growing interest in science and medicine. The 19th century saw increased curiosity about unusual medical conditions, often leading to public spectacles. Merrick's condition made him a subject of both scientific study and public exhibition.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The portrayal of Merrick as the "Elephant Man" evokes both empathy and fascination. The title itself represents how society viewed and labeled him based on his physical appearance. Merrick's condition challenged conventional notions of beauty and humanity, symbolizing the harsh realities of social marginalization and the human tendency to categorize those who differ from the norm as "other."</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>The artwork employs realism, capturing the anatomical abnormalities in meticulous detail. The use of shading highlights the texture and depth of Merrick's skin and skeletal structure, providing a stark yet respectful visualization of his condition. This detailed representation serves as an educational tool, communicating the medical complexities of his deformities through visual means.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Merrick's life and the artwork underscore the social and cultural inequities of the time. Displayed in freak shows and medical exhibitions, Merrick's experience reflects societal exploitation and the lack of understanding or compassion for individuals with disabilities. The artwork echoes the tension between scientific curiosity and ethical considerations in how society treated those with rare conditions.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Joseph Merrick's condition was historically misdiagnosed as elephantiasis. Today, it is believed he had Proteus syndrome, a rare genetic disorder causing overgrowth of skin, bones, and other tissues. This condition results in asymmetric growth, leading to the striking and unusual appearance documented in the artwork.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The artwork captures several pathological signs, such as skin overgrowth, limb deformities, and skeletal distortions. These are significant indicators of Proteus syndrome. The detailed illustration provides insight into the extent of Merrick's condition, highlighting areas of the body where abnormalities were most pronounced.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>During Merrick's lifetime, there were no treatments to halt or reverse the progression of his condition. Contemporary management of Proteus syndrome focuses on early diagnosis, symptomatic treatment, and supportive care, with interventions to address complications such as infection or orthopedic issues.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Joseph Merrick's quality of life was greatly influenced by social factors, including poverty, isolation, and lack of access to adequate medical care. His condition rendered him an outcast, struggling to find employment and acceptance. The artwork serves as a reminder of the impact societal factors have on individuals with medical conditions.</p>
