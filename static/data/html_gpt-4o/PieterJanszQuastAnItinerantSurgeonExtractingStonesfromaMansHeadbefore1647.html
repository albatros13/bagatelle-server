        <h1>Pieter Jansz Quast: An Itinerant Surgeon Extracting Stones from a Man's Head (1647)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        Pieter Jansz Quast was a Dutch painter known for his satirical genre scenes. Active during the Dutch Golden Age, Quast's work often depicted the folly and eccentricities of contemporary society, using humor and irony to comment on the human condition. His paintings are characterized by vivid portrayals of everyday life, with a particular focus on medical scenes and surgical practice.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        Created in 1647, this artwork reflects the cultural and medical understandings of the 17th-century Netherlands. This period is marked by significant developments in trade, science, and art, known as the Dutch Golden Age. Despite advances in other fields, medical practice remained rudimentary, often steeped in tradition and superstition, as illustrated by Quast's depiction of a medieval surgical procedure.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        The artwork portrays an itinerant surgeon supposedly extracting stones from a man's head, symbolizing the bizarre medical procedures of the time. During this period, such "stone cutting" was believed to cure insanity or severe headaches, representing the limited scientific understanding. The exaggerated expressions and postures of the figures serve as a satirical commentary on the credulity and desperation of patients seeking cures.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        Quast utilizes a monochrome palette, emphasizing line and form over color to convey the seriousness of the subject while underlining its absurdity. The composition is crowded, with figures tightly packed around the central scene, heightening the sense of drama and chaos. The artist's use of light and shadow enhances the depth and draws attention to the action's focal point— the surgeon's hands.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        The artwork exposes the stark inequities in medical knowledge and care available to different social classes during the era. Itinerant surgeons often served poorer communities, where access to educated medical practitioners was limited. The scene highlights the vulnerability and exploitation of these populations by unqualified practitioners, underscoring larger socio-economic disparities.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        During the 17th century, many ailments that affected mental health or caused severe headaches were attributed to physical anomalies, such as stones in the head. These "stones" were believed to be tangible causes of disorders, though they do not correspond to any actual medical condition known today.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        The primary pathology depicted in the artwork, the supposed stone in the man's head, is an example of medieval pseudomedicine. The signs are not aligned with any real medical understanding but serve as an illustration of historical misconceptions, demonstrating the lengths to which people would go in search of cures.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        As depicted, the treatment involved a surgical procedure to "remove" the stones, often performed without anesthesia or proper sanitation, leading to high risks of infection and mortality. This reflects the limitations and dangers of contemporary medical practices.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Social determinants of illness apparent in the artwork include a lack of access to accurate medical knowledge and healthcare services, especially among the lower classes. Limited education and economic barriers contributed to the prevalence of and reliance on itinerant surgeons who performed these procedures.
