        <h1>Diego Velázquez's The Buffoon Sebastián de Morra</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist</h2>
        <p>Diego Velázquez, a crucial figure in Western art, was a 17th-century Spanish painter renowned for his expressive realism and innovative use of light. He was a leading artist at the court of King Philip IV of Spain.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>"The Buffoon Sebastián de Morra" was painted in 1644 during Spain's Siglo de Oro, a period characterized by flourishing arts amidst political and economic decline. Court jesters, like Sebastián de Morra, often occupied ambivalent positions, serving as entertainers and representations of the king's power over anomalies.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting is rich in symbolism, with Morra's solemn expression defying the traditional comic role of a jester, inviting viewers to ponder the humanity beneath societal roles. The lavish yet restrained use of clothing suggests a duality of status and marginalization.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Velázquez employs dramatic chiaroscuro, enhancing Morra's figure against a subdued background, drawing attention to his expression. The naturalistic rendering and attention to texture are quintessentially Baroque, emphasizing realism and emotion.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting underscores societal inequality, portraying a figure both elevated in status by proximity to royalty and marginalized by physical difference. Court jesters were visible yet invisible, their humanity often eclipsed by entertainment value.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Sebastián de Morra likely had achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism, characterized by short stature and limbs, resulting from genetic mutations affecting bone growth.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the painting, Morra's disproportionate limbs and broader forehead are noticeable indicators, features typically associated with achondroplasia. Velázquez's depiction is sympathetic, avoiding caricature.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the 17th century, there was no medical treatment for dwarfism. Individuals with dwarfism often found roles within royal courts, where they were both supported and objectified.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Dwarfism, in this context, altered Morra's life opportunities significantly, confining him to roles determined by his physical condition rather than personal choice, reflecting broader attitudes towards disability.</p>
