        <h2>A Young Woman Aged 23 Depicted Before and After Contracting Cholera</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>
            This coloured stipple engraving lacks clear attribution but represents a typical example of 19th-century medical illustration. Such works were often produced by artists collaborating with physicians to accurately depict medical conditions for educational purposes. The precision and clarity suggest an artist trained in both anatomical accuracy and portraiture.
        </p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>
            The artwork dates back to the 19th century, a period characterized by industrialization, urbanization, and scientific advancement. Cholera pandemics were rampant during this time, particularly in Europe and North America, as cities with inadequate sanitation systems became breeding grounds for the disease. The impact of cholera was profound, leading to public health reforms and advancements in medical science.
        </p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>
            The dichotomy presented in the engraving—showing the woman before and after contracting cholera—symbolizes the devastating impact of the disease. The healthy image contrasts sharply with the depiction of illness, emphasizing the physical transformation caused by cholera. This visual comparison serves as both a warning and an invitation to reflect on the fragility of life.
        </p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>
            The artwork employs elements such as line, form, and color to create a stark contrast between health and illness. The use of stipple technique, which involves small dots to create shading and texture, enhances the realism. The symmetry of having two portraits side-by-side underscores the narrative of change, while the neutral background focuses attention solely on the subject.
        </p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>
            Cholera disproportionately affected the poor living in urban slums with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. This engraving implicitly reflects the socio-economic inequities of the time, highlighting how public health crises often exacerbate social divides. Such works spurred public health movements aiming to improve living conditions and access to medical care.
        </p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>
            Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>. It is primarily spread through contaminated water and food. Symptoms include severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, which can swiftly lead to death if untreated. Understanding cholera's etiology was essential in controlling its spread and improving sanitation practices.
        </p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>
            In the artwork, the physical signs of cholera are illustrated in the woman's emaciated appearance, sunken eyes, and expression indicating distress. Such visual signifiers were crucial for educating the public and medical community about the symptoms and severity of the disease.
        </p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>
            During the 19th century, cholera treatment was limited, with varying approaches including rehydration, medication, and rudimentary quarantine measures. Later discoveries emphasized oral rehydration solutions as a cornerstone in treating dehydration caused by cholera. Public health measures focused on improving water sanitation and hygiene.
        </p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>
            Factors such as poverty, lack of access to clean water, and overcrowding were significant social determinants of cholera outbreaks. These conditions enabled the rapid spread of the disease and highlighted the need for systemic public health reforms.
