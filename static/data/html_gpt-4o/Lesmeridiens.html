        <h1>Les meridiens</h1>
        
        <h2>a. Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork titled “Les meridiens” is an intricate depiction of human anatomy based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) philosophical beliefs. As such, it likely traces its roots back to a collective understanding and artistic representation developed by Chinese scholars and practitioners over centuries. While specific artists who contributed to the formation of these images may remain unnamed, the artworks are collectively rooted in a rich tradition of TCM. Such images served as educational tools to convey the complex system of meridians, which are believed to channel vital energy, or "Qi," throughout the body.</p>
        
        <h2>b. Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The system of meridians is fundamental to TCM, which has a historical context extending back over 2,000 years. This practice had its development and evolution during a time when medicine and spirituality were often intertwined, particularly in ancient China. The drawing of meridians likely began during the Warring States period (475–221 BCE) and became formalized in subsequent dynastic periods, prominently during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE). This era placed substantial emphasis on harmonizing bodily elements with the universe's rhythms, reflecting a socio-cultural context wherein health was perceived as a balance within natural and cosmic laws.</p>
        
        <h2>c. Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The meridians depicted in the artwork act as symbolic maps of the human body, representing the passageways through which life energy flows. This iconography underpins the holistic health philosophy in TCM, where maintaining unobstructed energy flow relates directly to health and well-being. Each meridian is aligned with specific organs, bodily functions, and elements (such as wood, fire, earth, metal, and water), indicating a symbolic relationship between the external environment and internal physiological processes.</p>
        
        <h2>d. Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork's stylistic attributes include detailed line work, precision, and clarity that are quintessential to educational illustrations. Employing simplicity and functionality, the design focuses on creating accessible and interpretable visual information. The use of intersecting lines, dotted paths, and annotated points exemplifies the principle of pattern and rhythm, directing attention systematically and consistently throughout the figure.</p>
        
        <h2>e. Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Historically, access to medical knowledge and practices represented by these meridian diagrams was likely limited to certain societal classes, creating cultural inequities regarding who could practice and benefit from TCM. Typically, this knowledge remained within certain scholarly and medical communities, which might not have been readily accessible to the lay public. Additionally, gender and class hierarchies may have dictated who could study and practice these arts extensively.</p>
        
        <h2>f. Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>In the framework of TCM as evidenced by this art, disease arises when the flow of Qi through the meridians is disrupted. Such disruptions might be attributed to factors like emotional stress, dietary imbalances, climatic conditions, or infections, each disturbing the body's delicate balance and energy flow, leading to various ailments.</p>
        
        <h2>g. Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Within TCM, observable symptoms such as pain, stiffness, or weakness along certain meridians can signify energy blockage or disharmony. These signs guide practitioners to diagnose ailments by correlating them with disrupted pathways, as depicted in the artwork, sensitizing them to the meridian-related signs of illness.</p>
        
        <h2>h. Treatment</h2>
        <p>Traditionally, treatments depicted through these meridian maps involve acupuncture, acupressure, moxibustion, herbal medicine, and Qi Gong practices. These methods aim to restore balance by stimulating specific points along the meridians, promoting the free flow of energy and thus health.</p>
        
        <h2>i. Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Diet, lifestyle, emotional well-being, and environmental conditions are recognized social determinants in TCM influencing illness. The philosophy encompassing meridian maps recognizes how collective and individual life circumstances can contribute to or mitigate illness by affecting the flow and balance of Qi.</p>
