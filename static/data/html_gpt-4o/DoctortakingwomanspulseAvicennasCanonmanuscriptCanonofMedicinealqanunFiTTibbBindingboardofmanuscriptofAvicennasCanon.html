        <h2>Avicenna's Canon of Medicine: Art and Science Interwoven</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork originates from the Islamic Golden Age and is a part of Avicenna's "Canon of Medicine," an influential medical text written by the Persian polymath Avicenna (Ibn Sina). This manuscript artwork was likely crafted by skilled Persian artists known for their intricate miniatures, indicative of the Islamic artistic style.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h3>
        <p>Created around the 11th century, during the Islamic Golden Age, this period was marked by profound advancements in science, medicine, and the arts. The Canon of Medicine became a principal medical reference in both the Islamic world and Europe for several centuries. This era was also characterized by cultural exchanges among scholars, merchants, and travelers across the vast Islamic empire.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The artwork depicts a physician examining a woman's pulse, embodying an early illustration of medical practice. The intricate floral and geometric patterns surrounding the figures represent the harmony between humans and the universe, a principle integral to Islamic art. The depiction captures the respect afforded to medical practitioners and the significance of diagnostic techniques in the medieval Islamic world.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>This miniature is characterized by its meticulous detail, use of vibrant colors, and intricate patterns. The composition is balanced, with the central figures framed by a lush, patterned background. The artists employed linear techniques and flat colors typical of Persian miniatures, focusing on ornamental beauty and symmetrical design.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The artwork illustrates the gender dynamics of the period, where male physicians predominantly practiced medicine, often depicting medical exchange within an elite context. However, it also underscores the height of medical advancement in a culturally rich era, highlighting the importance of knowledge across different social strata albeit limited by gender and class.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The artwork does not explicitly depict a specific disease but represents the diagnosis practice of pulse examination. This was crucial for identifying various ailments, ranging from fevers to internal imbalances, which were believed to be linked to the humoral theory — a prevalent medical theory in medieval Islamic medicine.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Pulse examination was an essential diagnostic tool. Variations in pulse strength, rhythm, and speed were believed to indicate different health conditions, thus serving as primary signifiers for internal imbalances affecting a patient's health, a method that continues to influence modern medical practices.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment in Avicenna's time involved adjusting the humors using dietary changes, herbal remedies, and other natural treatments. The Canon emphasized prevention, focusing on maintaining health through balanced living, hygiene, and regulated sleep, alongside using medicinal herbs and natural therapies.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>In the historical context, access to medical knowledge and treatment was often limited to higher social classes. Social determinants, such as socioeconomic status, gender, and geography, heavily influenced access to health care. These elements continue to echo in modern discussions on healthcare equity.</p>
