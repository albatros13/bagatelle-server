        <h2>Luciano Nezzo A Surgeon Holding a Dental Key Behind his Back to Conceal It From The Patient (1900)</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The painting "A Surgeon Holding a Dental Key Behind his Back to Conceal It From The Patient" was created by Italian artist Luciano Nezzo. Known for his vivid and expressive depiction of everyday scenes, Nezzo delves into the dynamics of medical practices through his artwork. His keen observational skills and meticulous detail reflect the nuances of human interactions within historical contexts.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>This artwork dates back to the year 1900, a period marked by transformative advances in medical science and dental practices. During this era, dentistry was evolving from rudimentary extractions towards more sophisticated procedures, although many areas still relied on traditional and sometimes crude methods. The socio-cultural setting of the early 20th century was a mix of scientific optimism and lingering traditional practices, which is reflected in Nezzo’s work.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The dental key held behind the surgeon's back is the central symbolic element in this painting. It signifies the fear and deception involved in medical treatments of the era. The concealing of the tool implies a lack of transparency, common during a time where patient consent and comfort were often secondary to the procedure itself. The posture and expressions of the figures further emphasize the tension between practitioner and patient.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>Nezzo employs realism to encapsulate this intimate yet tense moment between the surgeon and the patient. The use of chiaroscuro, a technique characterized by dramatic contrasts between light and dark, highlights the central figures and adds an emotional depth to the painting. Nezzo’s attention to detail in the clothing and facial expressions enriches the narrative and draws the viewer into the intimate and historical reality of the scene.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The painting subtly addresses the power imbalance inherent in medical practices of the time. Patients often had little agency and were at the mercy of practitioners, reflected by the hidden dental key, implying deceit. This symbolizes the broader societal inequities where medical professionals held significant power over individuals' bodily autonomy.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>During the early 1900s, dental issues such as toothaches and oral infections were common. Poor oral hygiene and limited dental care options often led to severe tooth decay. People often resorted to extractions as a primary treatment, as seen in this painting. The etiology typically involves bacterial infection leading to decay, exacerbated by inadequate preventive measures.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The patient’s expression of discomfort and the dramatized action of the surgeon indicate the painful nature of dental procedures during this era. Signs such as swelling, visible decay, or damage were often indicators necessitating extraction, which is illustrated through the tense interaction portrayed in the artwork.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>The primary treatment depicted involves the use of a dental key, an instrument used for extracting teeth. While this was among the more advanced tools available at the time, the process was often painful and carried risks such as infection. The painting captures a moment of hesitance and concealment linked to the surgical practice.</p>
        
        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Access to dental care was significantly determined by social and economic status. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often had limited access to advanced treatments and preventive care, leading to high prevalence of dental issues. This painting can be seen as a reflection of these disparities, highlighting underlying social determinants of health.</p>
