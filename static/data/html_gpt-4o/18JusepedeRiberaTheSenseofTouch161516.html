        <h1>The Sense of Touch by Jusepe de Ribera</h1>
        <h2>a. Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Jusepe de Ribera was a Spanish Tenebrist painter and printmaker, born in 1591. He is notable for his dramatic use of light and shadow, also known as chiaroscuro. Ribera’s works are often associated with the Baroque period in European art, representing strong emotional expression and realism. As a leading figure in the Neapolitan school, his paintings reflect not only an intense devotion to naturalism but also a psychological depth that distinguishes many of his compositions.</p>
        
        <h2>b. Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Created in 1615-1616, "The Sense of Touch" belongs to a series representing the five senses. The early 17th century was a time of heightened interest in sensory experiences within European art and science. The Baroque era, marked by a religious counter-reformation in Southern Europe, encouraged art that evoked emotional responses to convey religious messages.</p>
        
        <h2>c. Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting symbolizes the sense of touch through the figure gently feeling a marble bust. The artist's use of physical contact to depict sensory perception is reflective of the interconnectedness of human experience and knowledge acquisition during the Baroque period. The marble head could symbolize classical knowledge or wisdom, suggesting a tactile exploration of the ancient world.</p>
        
        <h2>d. Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Ribera’s intricate detailing and dramatic use of light lend his work a poignant realism. The composition is balanced, employing principles of chiaroscuro with dark background contrasting vividly with the highlighted figure. This serves not only to highlight the primary subject but also enriches the thematic exploration of sensory experience.</p>
        
        <h2>e. Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During Ribera’s time, social disparities were prevalent, often reflecting broader inequities of wealth and class, apparent in access to education and art. This painting, depicting a learned figure engaging with art and knowledge, subtly underscores distinctions between those with access to cultured exploration versus those focused on survival within early modern European society.</p>
        
        <h2>f. Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The artwork does not directly depict a specific medical condition. However, representations of touch and sensory interactions could indirectly relate to conditions affecting sensory perceptions, such as neuropathies, that were poorly understood during Ribera’s lifetime.</p>
        
        <h2>g. Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the context of touch, diseases like leprosy or peripheral neuropathy might reduce tactile sensitivity. While absent in Ribera’s depiction, the painting’s exploration of touch emphasizes the privilege of a fully functional sensory experience, highlighting deficits by contrast.</p>
        
        <h2>h. Treatment</h2>
        <p>Medical understanding in the early 17th century was limited, with treatments based largely on classical texts. Herbal remedies and rudimentary surgical procedures were common, though the effectiveness was highly variable and often rudimentary by modern standards.</p>
        
        <h2>i. Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The era was characterized by poor sanitation, widespread poverty, and limited medical knowledge, all contributing to the prevalence of illness. Access to medical care was generally restricted to those with means, further exacerbating social inequalities in health contexts.</p>
