        <h1>What the Old Masters Knew About Anatomy: Michelangelo</h1>
        
        <h2>a) Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork under consideration is attributed to Michelangelo Buonarroti, a renowned Italian Renaissance artist known for his contributions in sculpture, painting, and architecture. His works are celebrated for their mastery of human anatomy, and he remains a monumental figure in the art world.</p>

        <h2>b) Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo's artistic career spanned the late 15th and early 16th centuries, a period known as the High Renaissance. This was a time characterized by a transformational shift toward naturalism and the human figure in art. The Renaissance in Italy was marked by a revival of classical knowledge, intellectual inquiry, and artistic expression.</p>

        <h2>c) Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo's anatomical studies were not merely scientific endeavors; they were imbued with symbolism. His depictions of the human body often suggest themes of divine creation and human potential. The musculature and form are not only anatomically correct but also idealized, reflecting Renaissance ideals of beauty and perfection.</p>

        <h2>d) Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo's art is characterized by dynamic composition, expressive forms, and attention to detail. The principles of balance, proportion, and rhythm are evident in his anatomical sketches. The use of line and shading to depict the volume and definition of muscles demonstrates his grasp of form and structure.</p>

        <h2>e) Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During the Renaissance, social structures in Europe were rigid, with significant hierarchical divisions. Art was often a privilege of the wealthy, commissioned by the church or the elite class. Consequently, Michelangelo’s work primarily served the interests of these patrons, impacting the themes and subjects he explored.</p>

        <h2>f) Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While Michelangelo's anatomical drawings were not intended to depict disease, they nevertheless contribute to an understanding of the body that informs medical science. Generally, the drawings reflect a concern with function and vitality rather than pathology.</p>

        <h2>g) Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Pathological aspects are not directly apparent in Michelangelo's anatomical studies. However, the muscular tensions and skeletal structures captured in his works allow modern viewers to consider how deviations might reflect illness or injury.</p>

        <h2>h) Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments during the Renaissance were limited and often based on rudimentary understanding of the human body. Michelangelo's dissections and anatomical studies aided in advancing the medical knowledge of the time, though they were not expressly focused on treatment methodologies.</p>

        <h2>i) Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>During the Renaissance, the understanding of social determinants of health was limited. Factors such as class, location, and access to knowledge influenced health outcomes, but these were not clearly articulated or recognized as they are today.</p>
