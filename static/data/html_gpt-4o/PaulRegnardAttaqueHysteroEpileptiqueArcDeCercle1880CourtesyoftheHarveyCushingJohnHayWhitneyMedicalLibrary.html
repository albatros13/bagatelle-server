        <h2>Paul Regnard - Attaque Hystero Epileptique Arc De Cercle</h2>
        
        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe:</strong><br>
        The artwork “Attaque Hystero Epileptique Arc De Cercle” was created by Paul Regnard, a French neurologist and artist active in the late 19th century. Regnard was known for his meticulous documentation of neurological disorders, which often involved combining art and science in unique ways.</p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame):</strong><br>
        The piece was created in 1880, a time when the medical field was experiencing a rapid evolution in clinical practices and theories about neurology. This period also marks the beginning of the systematic study of hysteria and epilepsy within a scientific and cultural context heavily influenced by patriarchal norms, which often marginalized women's health issues.</p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography:</strong><br>
        The image captures an arc-like posture, symbolic of the physical manifestations of hysteria and epilepsy as understood during that era. The rigid arc position was thought to epitomize a classical 'hysterical arc,' representing the dramatic physical expressions of psychological distress.</p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design):</strong><br>
        Regnard's work emphasizes high contrast and clarity, focusing on the sharp depiction of anatomical features to highlight the medical condition. With a minimalist background, the image concentrates the viewer’s attention on the physical form and pose, emphasizing the clinical aspect of the disorder.</p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities:</strong><br>
        The work highlights the gendered perceptions of neurological disorders. Women were predominantly diagnosed with hysteria during this time, reflecting broader societal views that often dismissed women's health concerns as exaggerated 'psychological' issues.</p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology:</strong><br>
        At the time, hysteria was understood as a condition characterized by psychological and emotional disturbances. It was often attributed to a supposed wandering uterus, reflecting the limited knowledge of women's health and prevalent medical theories of the era.</p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness:</strong><br>
        The image shows a patient in a pronounced arc de cercle position, a posture considered a key indicator of a hysterical or epileptic fit. Such physical manifestations were used as visual evidence to diagnose hysteria and epilepsy.</p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment:</strong><br>
        Treatments for hysteria during the late 19th century were varied and often invasive, ranging from rest cures to more extreme measures like hysterectomy. These treatments reflect the period's medical limitations and gender biases.</p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness:</strong><br>
        Social determinants such as gender, class, and education level influenced the diagnosis and treatment of hysteria. Women, especially from affluent backgrounds, were more frequently diagnosed, reflecting the socio-economic factors at play in medical diagnoses.</p>
