        <h2>Zhou Pei Qun - A Patient Receiving Manipulating Treatment for a Pain in the Shoulder (1890)</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        Zhou Pei Qun, an artist known for his detailed and delicate depictions of traditional Chinese medicine practices, is the creator of this artwork. His work often reflects the fusion of art and medicine, providing insight into historical medical treatments.

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        Created in 1890 during the late Qing Dynasty, this artwork reflects the traditional Chinese medical practices prevalent at that time. The era was marked by a mix of Western and traditional Chinese influences, with significant cultural exchanges occurring as China opened up to the world.

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        In this painting, the practitioner and patient symbolize the therapeutic relationship found in traditional Chinese medicine. The gentle manipulation represents the holistic approach of such practices, focusing on treating the patient's overall well-being rather than merely alleviating symptoms.

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        The artwork is characterized by its use of meticulous line work and smooth, harmonious color palettes typical of Chinese paintings. The composition is balanced, emphasizing the interaction between the practitioner and patient, thus drawing the viewer's eye to the central action of the manipulative treatment.

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        Traditional Chinese medicine historically varied in accessibility, often dependent on one's social and economic status. While the elite could afford elaborate treatments and practitioners, common folk usually relied on simpler, folk remedies, illustrating disparities in healthcare access.

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        The artwork depicts a patient with shoulder pain, a common ailment believed to be caused by imbalances in the body's energy (Qi) due to environmental and lifestyle factors. Specifically, it could result from poor posture, stress, or physical strain.

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        The patient’s body language and the practitioner’s focus suggest symptoms of stiffness, discomfort, and restricted movement indicative of musculoskeletal issues. The detailed depiction of manipulation suggests an attempt to relieve tension and restore mobility.

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        The treatment shown involves manipulative therapy, akin to what is now recognized as osteopathic or chiropractic adjustment. It aims to realign the body, enhance circulation, and optimize energy flow for pain relief and improved function.

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        Factors such as occupation, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle play critical roles in susceptibility to musculoskeletal issues. Traditionally, manual laborers were more prone to such ailments due to physical strain, whereas wealthier individuals could afford preventive care.
