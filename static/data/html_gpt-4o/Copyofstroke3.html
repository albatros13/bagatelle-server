        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis of "Stroke3"</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The piece titled "Stroke3" remains anonymous in terms of its creator’s identity, though it has been associated with the illuminated Byzantine manuscripts tradition. Artists within this tradition often focused on illustrating medical texts, thereby blending art with science.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>The Byzantine period, particularly known for its flourishing art and science from the 4th to 15th century, provides a broader context for "Stroke3". This era was notable for the integration of religious beliefs with scientific endeavors, a characteristic mirrored in the artwork's intricacies.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The artwork depicts two figures with distinct clothing, which might symbolize the status or expertise of the individuals, possibly a patient and a physician. Their interaction embodies the transfer of knowledge and the attempt to diagnose or heal an affliction, characteristic of medical imagery.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Flat planes and frontal figures are typical of Byzantine art, adhering to a stylistic approach that emphasized spiritual and intellectual clarity over naturalistic representation. The use of line and muted coloration directs focus to the figures’ expressions and gestures, crucial for storytelling.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The Byzantine society was structured with clear hierarchies, often mirrored in art. The portrayal of medical figures highlights both the reverence for medical knowledge and the exclusivity of access that created social boundaries between educated elites and the general populace.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The image possibly illustrates a historical understanding of stroke, known then as "apoplexy." The condition is characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and paralysis, typically due to cerebral blood flow disruptions, a concept just beginning to be explored during this period.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Signs depicted in the artwork, such as facial expression and body posture, may reflect symptoms associated with neurological disorders like stroke, such as asymmetry or immobility. Such visual cues were vital for medieval practitioners in diagnosing and understanding illness.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment during the Byzantine era was rudimentary, including methods such as bloodletting or herbal remedies. Artworks often visualize the hope and reliance on divine intervention, reflecting the period's reliance on both empirical and spiritual healing methods.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Access to medical knowledge and care was largely determined by social standing and wealth. Physicians were more accessible to the affluent, whose lifestyle could afford such luxury, imposing inherent inequalities in health outcomes related to economic disparities.</p>
