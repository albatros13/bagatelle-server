        <h2>Hubert Airy Depiction of Scotomas Transient Homiopsia Royal Society of London (1870)</h2>
        
        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</strong></p>
        <p>The artwork was created by Hubert Airy, a notable figure known for his contributions to the medical illustration of neurological phenomena. As a 19th-century physician, Airy is recognized for his detailed and scientifically valuable representations of visual disturbances.</p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</strong></p>
        <p>The image dates back to 1870, during a period marked by significant advancements in medical science and neurology. This era was characterized by a burgeoning interest in understanding the human brain and its disorders, paralleling the industrial revolution's broader scientific curiosity.</p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</strong></p>
        <p>The artwork captures the visual phenomenon of scotomas, representing them with accuracy and an artistic vision. The dark voids and intricate patterns are not only depictions of medical symptoms but also symbolize the mysterious and often misunderstood nature of neurological disorders.</p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</strong></p>
        <p>This illustration employs a combination of precise linework and contrast, effectively using black and white space to highlight the intricate patterns of scotomas. The use of color in the edges adds depth and complexity, drawing the viewer's eye through the artwork's flow.</p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</strong></p>
        <p>During the 19th century, access to medical knowledge and representation was limited, often skewed towards those with resources. Artistic works like Airy’s helped bring scientific phenomena into the public view, albeit still largely restricted to educated classes.</p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</strong></p>
        <p>The artwork is an illustration of scotomas associated with migraines. This transient visual phenomenon occurs due to retinal or neurological disturbances, characterized by blind spots or shimmering patterns in one's vision.</p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</strong></p>
        <p>Scotomas are signified by partial vision loss or areas of blurriness, often forming jagged, zig-zag patterns known as fortification spectra. These are often precursors to migraine headaches and an important diagnostic feature.</p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment</strong></p>
        <p>In the 19th century, treatment options for migraines were limited, often focusing on lifestyle changes and rudimentary interventions. Today, migraine management includes medications such as triptans, anti-inflammatories, and lifestyle modifications to reduce triggers.</p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</strong></p>
        <p>Migraines and related visual disturbances can be influenced by various social factors, including stress, diet, and access to healthcare. Understanding the role of these determinants is vital in managing and preventing such conditions.</p>
