        <h1>Day 711: The Daily Stream of Consciousness by Bobby Baker</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Bobby Baker is a contemporary British artist known for her unique approach to art, blending performance with drawing to explore lived experiences of health and illness. Her work is deeply personal, often drawing from her own life and struggles with mental health.</p>
        
        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Created in 2008, the artwork reflects the growing discourse around mental health in the early 21st century. It is from Baker's series "Diary Drawings: Mental Illness and Me," which documents her journey with mental health issues over an eleven-year period. This series emerged during a period when mental health was gaining more visibility and becoming a significant topic of conversation in public health narratives.</p>
        
        <h2>Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>"The Daily Stream of Consciousness" illustrates the complexities of consciousness and existence. The symbolic use of pathways and streams in the head alludes to the flow of thoughts and experiences that influence one's mental state. The imagery of bridges and boats may symbolize transitions and journeys in the mental landscape.</p>
        
        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Baker's artwork is characterized by its spontaneous and expressive style. Utilizing line and color effectively, she conveys intricate emotions. The whimsical, yet structured composition reflects the tension and harmony within the mind, employing principles such as contrast and movement to illustrate the chaotic yet ordered flow of thoughts.</p>
        
        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The piece addresses the stigmatization of mental health issues. By visually articulating her experiences, Baker challenges societal norms and raises awareness about the personal and cultural dimensions of mental illness. Her work aims to create a dialogue that fosters understanding and compassion.</p>
        
        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The artwork references mental health conditions, possibly including depression and anxiety, common issues in modern society. The etiology of these conditions often involves a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors.</p>
        
        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The flowing, meandering lines and layered imagery in the artwork suggest turbulence within the mind. The visual metaphor of water in the mind may imply emotional fluidity and instability, reflecting symptomatic patterns of mental health struggles.</p>
        
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Baker's journey is indicative of treatment methodologies that involve both professional and personal approaches. Therapy, medication, and self-expression through art are significant elements of her treatment and recovery process, highlighting the multifaceted nature of mental health care.</p>
        
        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social determinants such as access to healthcare, social support networks, education, and socioeconomic status can significantly affect mental health. Baker's work underscores the importance of addressing these systemic factors to promote mental wellness and understanding.</p>
