        <h2>Charles Eisenmann Artwork Analysis</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Charles Eisenmann was a prolific photographer during the late 19th century, known for his portraits of individuals participating in the sideshow or "freak show" industry. His works are characterized by the representation of individuals with unique physical conditions in a manner that bestowed dignity and humanity.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>The photo is set in the late 19th century, a period marked by the height of the circus and sideshow era. During this time, individuals with rare physical deformities were showcased as entertainment, often amidst both fascination and exploitation. Charles Eisenmann captured these subjects with a lens that sought more than mere spectacle.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h3>
        <p>The stark imagery of these photos serves to symbolize society’s fascination and simultaneous marginalization of those with physical anomalies. Eisenmann’s portraits, although products of their time, can be seen as attempts to provide agency through individual representation rather than reducing subjects to mere curiosities.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>Eisenmann’s photography exhibits a formal composition with careful attention to balance and symmetry. The use of lighting and soft focus delivers a sense of gravitas, while the detail in capturing the subjects’ gaze invites viewers into a dialogue about identity and perception beyond mere physicality.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The context of sideshows reflects broader societal inequities where marginalized groups were subjected to both objectification and financial exploitation. Despite modern interpretations that may see these exhibitions as unethical, at the time, they offered some individuals a means of livelihood. However, it was within a social structure that stigmatized their very existence.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The depicted condition is indicative of Elephantiasis, which is characterized by extreme swelling in the limbs due to lymphatic obstruction. The etiology of Elephantiasis can be attributed to Parasitic (Filariasis) or non-parasitic causes, the former being more common in tropical regions, often spread by mosquitoes.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Clinically, Elephantiasis manifests as marked swelling and thickening of the skin and underlying tissues, primarily affecting the lower extremities. These pathological changes are due to chronic lymphatic stasis and inflammation, leading to fibrosis and hypertrophy of subcutaneous tissues.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Traditional treatments revolve around managing symptoms and preventing secondary infections. This includes rigorous hygiene, use of anti-filarial medication in parasitic cases, and in severe scenarios, surgical intervention to remove excess tissue. Recent advances have focused on lymphatic-preserving techniques and therapeutic approaches.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The prevalence of Elephantiasis is closely linked to social determinants such as poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and living conditions which facilitate the spread of mosquito vectors in the case of Filariasis. Addressing these social factors is crucial in the eradication and management of the disease.</p>
