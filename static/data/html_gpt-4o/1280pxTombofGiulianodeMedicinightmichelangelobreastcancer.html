        <h1>Tomb of Giuliano de Medici</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The Tomb of Giuliano de Medici, crafted by Michelangelo, stands as a masterpiece of Renaissance art. Michelangelo, an Italian sculptor, painter, and architect, was a prominent figure of the High Renaissance. His works were characterized by their idealized yet realistic portrayal of the human form, emotional depth, and dynamic structure.</p>
        
        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created between 1520 and 1534, the tomb is located in the Medici Chapel in Florence, Italy. This period was marked by significant socio-political changes across Europe, including the Protestant Reformation and the rise of powerful city-states in Italy. Art played a crucial role in expressing personal and political power, and the patronage of the Medici family was instrumental in the flourishing of the arts during this time.</p>
        
        <h2>Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The tomb's figures, including those of Day and Night, embody complex symbolic meanings. Night, depicted as a reclining woman, may signify the inevitability of the cycle of life and death. The symbolic use of darkness and light reflects the dichotomies prominent in human existence, such as life and death, ignorance and enlightenment.</p>
        
        <h2>Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo's work is renowned for its dramatic use of the human form, muscular dynamism, and anatomical precision. His mastery of contrapposto imbues the figures with a sense of movement and tension. The balance and proportion within the sculpture highlight Michelangelo’s skill in blending form with narrative depth.</p>
        
        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The Medici family’s patronage of Michelangelo underscores the societal inequities of the time. The art commissioned was a reflection of power and wealth, often inaccessible to the less privileged. This patronage system perpetuated social hierarchies and emphasized the disparity between the affluent and the common populace.</p>
        
        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>There is speculation about the figures representing allegorical connections to disease, such as breast cancer, especially in the depiction of Night. This is more interpretive than historical, focusing on how contemporary observers might relate current medical knowledge to past works of art.</p>
        
        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The sculpture's depiction of the human form can be analyzed for potential signs of illness from a modern perspective, though these interpretations are subjective and not based on historical evidence of intention.</p>
        
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the Renaissance period, medical treatments were rudimentary, often reliant on herbal remedies and practices like bloodletting. The understanding of diseases such as cancer was limited, often attributed to imbalances in bodily humors or influenced by superstitions.</p>
        
        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social factors played a significant role in health during the Renaissance. Access to care was dictated by wealth and status, with the impoverished having little access to emerging medical knowledge. The Medici’s resources afforded them the best available treatments of the time.</p>
