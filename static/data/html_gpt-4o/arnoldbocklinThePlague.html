        <h2>The Plague by Arnold Bocklin</h2>

        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</strong><br>
        Arnold Böcklin was a Swiss symbolist painter known for his imaginative and mystical compositions. His work often explored themes of mythology, death, and the supernatural, which are evident in "The Plague."
        </p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</strong><br>
        Created in 1898, "The Plague" reflects the anxieties and fears of the late 19th century in Europe. This period was characterized by industrialization, scientific advancement, and a fascination with both mythology and modern existential uncertainties.
        </p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</strong><br>
        "The Plague" depicts Death astride a bat-like creature flying through a desolate town. The black figure represents the plague or death personified. The ominous environment and fallen figures below symbolize the helplessness and devastation caused by epidemics.
        </p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</strong><br>
        Böcklin’s use of dark, muted colors and dramatic lighting contributes to the painting's foreboding tone. The contrasting elements of light and shadow enhance the sense of chaos, while the dynamic composition creates a feeling of unease and motion.
        </p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</strong><br>
        Epidemics like the plague historically affected poorer communities more severely due to inadequate access to medical care and unsanitary living conditions, reflecting disparities in healthcare and social status that Böcklin might be subtly critiquing in his work.
        </p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</strong><br>
        Plague, particularly the bubonic form, is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, typically transmitted through flea bites or contact with infected animals. Historically, it led to catastrophic mortality, wiping out large populations in medieval Europe.
        </p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</strong><br>
        Common symptoms of bubonic plague include swollen lymph nodes, fever, chills, and weakness. Böcklin’s depiction of prostrate figures with contorted poses may signal the physical agony and lethargy associated with the illness.
        </p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment</strong><br>
        In the late 19th century, understanding of the plague and its treatments was still limited. Traditional approaches included quarantine and herbal remedies. Modern treatment involves the administration of antibiotics, which effectively combat Yersinia pestis if administered promptly.
        </p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</strong><br>
        Factors such as poverty, overcrowding, and access to healthcare significantly influence the spread and impact of diseases like the plague. Böcklin’s work serves as a grim reminder of how societal conditions can exacerbate the effects of epidemic outbreaks.
