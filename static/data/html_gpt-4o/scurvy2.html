        <h1>Scurvy: Artistic and Scientific Analysis</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork titled "Scurvy" is an engraving from the 19th century, reflecting the challenges faced by seafarers. The artist remains anonymous, yet the piece is emblematic of the era’s illustrative styles used in medical and exploration literature.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>During the Age of Sail (16th to 19th century), scurvy was a prevalent disease among sailors who embarked on long sea voyages without access to fresh produce. This era was marked by colonial expansion, where maritime expeditions were pivotal. The socio-economic consequences were significant, influencing naval operations and mortality rates among sailors.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The image symbolizes neglect and the dire conditions aboard ships. The emaciated bodies of sailors lying in a cramped berth reflect the despair caused by scurvy. The engraving serves as a potent reminder of the frailty of human health in the face of environmental hardships.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The use of monochromatic tones highlights the stark reality of the sailors' plight. The composition directs the viewer's gaze across the suffering figures, emphasizing the gravity of the situation. Hatching is employed to create depth and texture, characteristic of engravings of this period.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The depiction underscores the vulnerability of sailors, often from lower socio-economic backgrounds, who lacked the means or knowledge to prevent scurvy. The absence of preventive measures was compounded by a hierarchical neglect within naval policies towards the well-being of lower-ranking crew members.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Scurvy is a disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C, or ascorbic acid. It was first prevalent among sailors who had no access to fresh fruits and vegetables during long voyages. Without vitamin C, the synthesis of collagen—the glue that holds cells together—is impaired, leading to multiple systemic failures.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The hallmark signs of scurvy include lethargy, anemia, gum disease, and skin hemorrhages. In advanced stages, sufferers experienced severe joint pain, jaundice, fever, and in grave conditions, sudden death. The illustration captures the weakened, pallid state symptomatic of the illness.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The primary treatment for scurvy is the replenishment of vitamin C through dietary intake. Historical remedies involved the consumption of citrus fruits like lemons and limes, which were recognized as antiscorbutic. Recommendations for regular dietary inclusion of such fruits were not formalized until later centuries.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The development of scurvy was intricately linked to the socio-economic conditions of sailors. Limited access to diverse foods and lack of medical knowledge at the time contributed to its prevalence. Moreover, the logistics of maintaining nutrient-rich provisions over long voyages played a critical role.</p>
