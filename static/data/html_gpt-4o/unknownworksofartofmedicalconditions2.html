        <h2>Unknown Works of Art of Medical Conditions</h2>
        
        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</strong><br>
        The creator of this artwork remains unknown, which is common in historical medical illustrations. Such works were often created by trained illustrators tasked with documenting pathological conditions for medical purposes. These artists, whose identities frequently remain obscure, played a crucial role in the marriage between art and science.</p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</strong><br>
        Medical illustrations like this one gained prominence in the 19th century, an era marked by significant advancements in medical science. During this time, there was a burgeoning interest in documenting physical anomalies and developing medical knowledge to understand human differences. The socio-cultural backdrop of this period was characterized by exploring human physiology and pathology, amid the growing influence of scientific thought.</p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</strong><br>
        The artwork likely symbolizes the era's fascination with the 'abnormal' in medical science. Illustrations of medical conditions often served as didactic tools that encapsulated complex medical ideas. These depictions were loaded with symbolism relating to human frailty and the quest for medical mastery over nature's unpredictability.</p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</strong><br>
        This work showcases the detailed line work and precision typically found in medical illustrations of its time. Employing a combination of realism and scientific accuracy, the artist uses careful shading to bring forth anatomical details. The portrait-style presentation, focusing specifically on the profile of the subject, highlights the distinct features associated with the medical condition in question.</p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</strong><br>
        During the period, individuals with distinct medical conditions were often marginalized or stigmatized. Medical illustrations, while primarily scientific, sometimes reinforced societal views by depicting these conditions without the context of humanity or dignity. This reflects a broader historical pattern where medical abnormalities were exhibited publicly, emphasizing societal inequities.</p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</strong><br>
        The subject of the drawing seems to depict features consistent with acromegaly, a condition characterized by abnormal growth due to excess growth hormone. Acromegaly arises from the overproduction of growth hormone, typically due to a benign tumor on the pituitary gland.</p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</strong><br>
        In the artwork, the prominent brow, enlarged facial features, and visible changes in bodily proportions signify the presence of acromegaly. These physical signs are crucial for medical diagnosis and were often meticulously documented in illustrations for educational purposes.</p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment</strong><br>
        During the era when this illustration may have been made, treatment for acromegaly was limited. Modern treatments include surgical removal of the tumor, radiation therapy, and medication to reduce growth hormone production or its effects. Early identification plays a significant role in managing symptoms effectively.</p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</strong><br>
        Access to medical care, education, and awareness significantly affected individuals with acromegaly during this historical period. Socioeconomic status often determined the ability to seek treatment, resulting in disparities in health outcomes. These determinants continue to play crucial roles in modern healthcare landscapes.</p>
