        <h2>Baby John Being Nursed by Mary Cassatt (1910)</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Mary Cassatt was an American painter and printmaker who lived much of her adult life in France. She had a profound influence on the Impressionist movement and was recognized for her intimate portrayals of the lives of women, especially highlighting themes of motherhood.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>The painting was created in 1910, during a period marked by rapid industrialization and societal change. This era saw the growing participation of women in various social spheres although motherhood and childcare remained central themes in their societal roles. The Impressionist movement was waning by this time, yet Cassatt continued to explore its themes and techniques.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h3>
        <p>This artwork is a gentle depiction of the bond between mother and child. The nurturing act of breastfeeding symbolizes the intimate connection and dependency, emphasizing themes of care, warmth, and affection. It can be seen as a departure from society’s industrial focus, returning to basic human connections.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>The painting employs soft hues and brushstrokes typical of Cassatt’s style, invoking a sense of tenderness. The use of light and color adds warmth, making the viewer feel the tranquility of the scene. Compositionally, the close framing intensifies the personal nature of the moment.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Despite being an acclaimed artist, Mary Cassatt faced gender-based barriers in her career. Women artists often struggled for equal recognition and opportunities in a male-dominated art world. Her focus on themes of motherhood and femininity was sometimes underappreciated by a society that prioritized more masculine themes.</p>
        
        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The painting portrays breastfeeding, which holds significance in medical discussions around infant nutrition and maternal health. While not depicting disease per se, breastfeeding is known to confer immunity and reduce infant morbidity, thus indirectly informing health discussions.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>This image doesn’t showcase pathologies; instead, it illustrates healthy breastfeeding practices which are significant for child development and maternal health, an antithesis to illness narratives. The intimacy portrayed can also be interpreted as a broader metaphor for nurturing practices that prevent illness.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Breastfeeding is a natural process that benefits from minimal medical intervention, but it does require support systems for optimal execution. Encouraging healthy maternal practices and securing knowledgeable support are crucial aspects of treatment and prevention of conditions like malnutrition.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The painting indirectly emphasizes the importance of social support for mothers. Societal and familial support, economic stability, and education are all determinants that strongly influence maternal and infant health outcomes, highlighting disparities that can lead to illness if not addressed.</p>
