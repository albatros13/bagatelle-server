        <h1>Frontispiece of John Browne Myographia Nova Or A Graphical Description of All of the Muscles in the Humane Body As They Arise in Dissection</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork featured here is attributed to John Browne, a prominent figure in the field of anatomy during the 17th century. Though Browne was more of a compiler and teacher than an artist, this frontispiece reflects his dedication to disseminating anatomical knowledge. The illustrations were likely created by skilled engravers working under his direction.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The late 1600s were a transformative period in medical history, marked by advances in understanding human anatomy. This era, just after the Renaissance, saw increasing acceptance of dissection as an educational tool in medicine. John Browne's Myographia Nova, published in 1698, stands as a testament to the era’s pursuit of knowledge through detailed anatomical studies.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The frontispiece of Browne’s work is rich with symbolic elements. The pose of the figure in the artwork may symbolize the Renaissance ideal of the 'Vitruvian Man,' linking physical perfection with scientific discovery. Additionally, the surrounding elements illustrate the foundational knowledge of human musculature, serving as an educational motif.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The illustration is characterized by meticulous line work and a high level of detail. The use of chiaroscuro—a contrast of light and dark—adds depth, making the anatomical details both informative and visually captivating. This attention to both scientific accuracy and aesthetic composition highlights the dual focus on art and science during this period.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During the 17th century, anatomical studies were largely confined to well-funded academic and medical institutions, often inaccessible to women and lower socioeconomic classes. This restriction perpetuated social inequities, as the knowledge contained within works like Browne's was pivotal for medical and scientific advancement.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While the frontispiece itself does not depict a specific disease, it is concerned with the structure of muscles, which are fundamental to understanding numerous muscular and neurological conditions. Any dysfunction in these muscles can hint at diseases that were at the time poorly understood.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the context of the time, signs of muscle wasting or unusual muscle growth in depictions like this could suggest pathologies. However, due to limited medical knowledge, many muscles’ functions and related diseases remained purely speculative. The focus was primarily on structure rather than symptomatic disease representations.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The 17th-century treatment of muscular diseases was rudimentary, often limited to herbal remedies, physical therapy, and rudimentary surgeries without anesthesia. This period marked the beginning of more systematic approaches to treatment, as anatomical knowledge began to inform medical practice more directly.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Access to medical knowledge, such as that found in Myographia Nova, was a significant social determinant of health. Social class, education, and access to physicians trained in these new anatomical teachings were key in determining the quality of healthcare one could receive.</p>
