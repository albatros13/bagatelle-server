        <h1>Andy Pitts Zombie Phrenology: Parodying Outdated Science</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork "Zombie Phrenology" is created by Andy Pitts. Pitts is known for his satirical approach, often engaging in a critical dialogue with historical and scientific themes. His work frequently uses humor to critique established narratives and social conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The artwork is set in a contemporary context, reflecting on historical practices through a modern lens. Phrenology, the pseudoscientific study of skull shapes to determine mental faculties, gained popularity in the early 19th century. Andy Pitts revisits this outdated science to critique current societal implications and scientific malpractices.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The imagery used by Pitts utilizes elements associated with phrenology, such as labeled cranial sections, to parody its absurdity. By depicting a zombie, Pitts amplifies the absurdity, suggesting that such pseudosciences are as mindless as the undead. Each labeled section humorously comments on the typical attributes of zombies—persistence, hunger, and a lack of grace.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Pitts' use of monochromatic tones and bold lines reflects a distinctive graphic style reminiscent of vintage anatomy illustrations. The controlled use of line drawing and shading provides clarity while creating a juxtaposition between scientific precision and the chaotic nature of the undead subject.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The piece subtly addresses social inequities by challenging the historical prejudice in pseudosciences like phrenology, which often reinforced racial and social biases. By illustrating a zombie, Pitts universalizes the subject, critiquing the lack of critical thought in these outdated concepts that wrongly influenced social dynamics.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>In a biomedical context, the artwork portrays the fictional 'disease' of zombification, a frequent theme in pop culture. While zombies are figments of fiction, their depiction often symbolizes societal fears related to diseases with neurological impacts.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Phrenology aside, signs of the so-called 'zombie condition' include sluggishness, an insatiable appetite for brains, and marked cognitive deficits. These aspects humorously highlight how pseudosciences attributed simplistic explanations to complex human behaviors.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The inclusion of zombification as an illness underlines the absurdity in past methods categorized under pseudoscience. It serves as a metaphor for the futile treatment methods that were suggested for behaviors allegedly linked to different skull shapes.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Pitts hints at the notion that societal beliefs can shape perceptions of mental health and illness. Historical periods where pseudosciences flourished often saw marginalized groups targeted based on these flawed scientific claims, affecting societal perception and treatment of mental health.</p>
