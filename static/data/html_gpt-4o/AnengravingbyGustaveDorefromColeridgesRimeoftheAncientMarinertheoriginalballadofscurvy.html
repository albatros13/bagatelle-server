        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        Gustave Doré was a highly influential French artist and illustrator known for his detailed and imaginative engravings. Born in 1832 in Strasbourg, Doré was a self-taught prodigy whose work spanned various literary classics, including the Bible, Dante's "Divine Comedy," and Milton's "Paradise Lost." His artistic style and creative imagination were instrumental in defining the visual interpretation of many beloved literary works.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        This engraving was created in the 19th century during a time of significant change and exploration. The Victorian era was marked by a fascination with the supernatural, scientific curiosity, and expanding global exploration. Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," from which this engraving is taken, embodies the Romantic Movement's obsession with nature, the unknown, and the mysterious.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        Doré's engraving is rich with symbolism, particularly in its depiction of the albatross—a central figure in Coleridge's poem. The albatross represents nature and fate, its death bringing misfortune upon the crew. This scene captures the eerie, otherworldly atmosphere of the poem, emphasizing the themes of isolation, supernatural retribution, and the sublime power of nature.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        Doré's work is characterized by intricate detail, dramatic contrasts of light and shadow, and a commanding sense of movement and depth. His use of line and texture creates a vivid and atmospheric scene that draws viewers into the narrative. The composition emphasizes the verticality and precariousness of the ship and the crew, creating tension and anticipation.

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        The narrative of the Ancient Mariner highlights themes of punishment and fate, reflecting broader societal concerns about morality and human agency. During this era, the British class system and imperialism presented inequities that often mirrored the social and moral struggles depicted in literature and art.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        Scurvy, a disease resulting from a deficiency of Vitamin C, is historically associated with sailors on long voyages. The lack of fresh fruit and vegetables led to debilitating symptoms such as weakness, anemia, and gum disease. This engraving, tied to the narrative of scurvy, underscores the peril faced by seafarers.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        Symptoms of scurvy depicted historically include swollen, bleeding gums, opening of healed wounds, and lethargy. Doré captures the desperation and deteriorating conditions aboard the ship, reflecting the severity of these symptoms on the afflicted crew.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        The most effective treatment for scurvy is the consumption of Vitamin C-rich foods, such as citrus fruits. By the late 18th century, the British Navy began issuing lemon or lime juice to sailors, significantly reducing incidences of the disease.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Factors contributing to scurvy included socioeconomic status, dietary availability, and living conditions. Sailors, often from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, were particularly vulnerable due to inadequate shipboard provisions. This reflects broader themes of class and access to resources.
