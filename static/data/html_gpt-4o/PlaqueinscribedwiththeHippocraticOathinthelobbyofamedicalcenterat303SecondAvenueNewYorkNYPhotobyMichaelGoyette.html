        <h1>Plaque Inscribed with the Hippocratic Oath</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The plaque in question is a modern adaptation and presentation of the Hippocratic Oath, a historical document originating from ancient Greece. Identifying a singular artist or group responsible for this particular plaque can be difficult, as it may be part of a commissioned piece specifically for the medical facility located at 303 Second Avenue, New York. The depiction of such artwork is often curated by a team of designers or artists skilled in calligraphy and classic art styles, reflecting the ethos of medical practice and history.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This plaque represents the enduring influence of the Hippocratic Oath, originally written in the late 5th century BCE by Hippocrates, a figure often lauded as one of the founders of Western medicine. The contemporary installation of this inscription in a medical center echoes the persistence of medical ethics through ages, transitioning from ancient Greek traditions into modern-day medical practices.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h2>
        <p>The imagery on the plaque, with classical motifs and decorative elements, symbolizes the revered tradition and solemnity of the oath-taking process. The ornate script and the antiquated style attempt to bridge past cultural philosophies with current ethical standards, reaffirming the moral duties of medical professionals encapsulated by the Hippocratic Oath.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The plaque combines elements of classical art design, including symmetry, proportion, and intricate detailing. The calligraphy is a significant component, reflecting an ancient script, thereby emphasizing the historical origin of the document. Such stylistic decisions are intended to create a sense of legacy and gravity associated with the medical profession.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The Hippocratic Oath, while a foundational ethical guide, did not originally account for issues of gender and social status equity present in modern times. Historically, the practice of medicine was restricted primarily to men, with women and enslaved individuals often excluded from formal medical training and recognition. Contemporary applications of the Oath, like the plaque, attempt to mitigate these disparities by promoting inclusivity and diversity within the healthcare field.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The Hippocratic Oath does not directly describe diseases or their causes but lays the groundwork for physicians to approach illness with ethical responsibility. It underscores the importance of practicing medicine for the benefit of patients while minimizing harm, a principle that underlies the study of disease etiology in biomedical science.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Pathology during Hippocrates' time was largely observational. Signifiers of illness were mainly diagnostic through observation and examination rather than sophisticated technology. Although the Oath does not detail specific pathologies, it advocates for careful assessment and conscientious treatment.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The Hippocratic Oath encapsulates the philosophy of doing no harm, which is central to treatment protocols across cultures and times. Physicians are urged to abstain from administering deadly medicine, reflecting early understandings that ethical practice in treatment is critical.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The ethical guide addresses respecting the privacy and dignity of all patients, a recognition of the social determinants that can affect health outcomes. There is an indirect acknowledgment of these factors in the way treatment is administered, aiming for equity in care.</p>
