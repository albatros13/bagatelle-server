            <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
            <p>The artwork implicitly touches upon themes of class and access to healthcare in early 20th-century America.

            <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
            <p>An emphasis on empathy and communication is depicted as therapeutic. The doctor's gentle interaction suggests that attentiveness to emotional and psychological needs is as important as treating physical ailments. This highlights early integrative approaches in medical practice.</p>
