        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis: Christ Heals a Paralytic</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork "Christ Heals a Paralytic" is part of the elaborate illuminated manuscript known as the Gospel of Tsar Ivan Alexander. Commissioned during the reign of Tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria, it exemplifies the artistic achievements of the Tarnovo School of Painting, which was prominent in the Middle Ages.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>Created in the 14th century, during the Second Bulgarian Empire, this manuscript represents a time when Orthodox Christianity played a fundamental role in shaping Bulgarian society and culture. Under Tsar Ivan Alexander's patronage, art and literature flourished, reflecting the religious fervor and political stability of the period.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The scene depicted in the manuscript, of Christ healing a paralytic, is rich with symbolism. Christ's gesture of healing signifies divine intervention and omnipotence. The surrounding figures emphasize faith and the miraculous powers attributed to Christ. This narrative underscores the Christian values of compassion, faith, and redemption.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>The artwork is characterized by vibrant colors and intricate detailing typical of medieval manuscript illumination. The figures are stylized, with elongated proportions and rigid poses, reflecting the Byzantine influence. The use of gold leaf in the manuscript highlights the divine nature of the scene and enhances its sacred ambiance.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>During its creation, the societal structure was heavily hierarchical, with the church playing a central role. Access to religious texts and artworks like this manuscript was limited to the elite class, pointing towards a cultural disparity in access to religious and educational resources.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The narrative centers around a man afflicted with paralysis, a condition characterized by the loss of muscle function in part of the body. Paralysis can result from various causes including trauma, stroke, or neurological disorders. In this historical context, paralysis would have been seen as a divine punishment or a test of faith.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>In the artwork, the paralytic is typically depicted as lying on a mat or being carried by others, illustrating his inability to move independently. These visual cues emphasize his helplessness and reliance on others, making his miraculous healing all the more significant in the narrative.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>In the story, the treatment is spiritual rather than medical—Christ heals the paralytic through faith and miraculous intervention. Historically, treatments for paralysis were limited and often compounded by superstitions. Prayer and religious rituals were commonly relied upon in the absence of scientific understanding.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>In medieval society, the social determinants of illness were closely linked to one's social status and access to resources. The paralytic's position in the community would determine his quality of life and access to care, further emphasizing societal inequities.</p>
