        <h1>The Sick Child</h1>
        <h2>Edvard Munch</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Edvard Munch was a Norwegian painter born on December 12, 1863, in Loten, Norway. He is best known for his intense and evocative treatment of psychological themes, which influenced the development of German Expressionism in the early 20th century. Munch’s most famous work, "The Scream," has become one of the most iconic images of art, but "The Sick Child" is another profound piece reflecting his significant personal and artistic evolution.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>"The Sick Child" was painted in 1885–1886, a time when Munch was heavily influenced by Symbolism and sought to express the internal emotional turmoil through art. The late 19th century in Norway was a period of burgeoning national identity and cultural renewal. Munch's works were initially met with criticism in Norway, as they deviated from the traditional techniques and themes that were popular at the time.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The painting is deeply autobiographical, representing the illness and eventual death of Munch’s eldest sister, Johanne Sophie, from tuberculosis, a common and deadly disease of that era. The work symbolizes the pain and helplessness associated with watching a loved one suffer. The halo effect around the child’s head and the sorrowful stoop of the adult figure connote religious iconography, hinting at martyrdom and piety often depicted in traditional religious art.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>Munch’s use of loose brushwork, an ethereal color palette, and the blurred, dreamlike quality emphasizes the emotional intensity and personal nature of the painting. The lack of defined lines and the subdued monochromatic tones help to create a somber and poignant atmosphere, echoing the themes of illness and loss. The positioning of the two figures creates a triangular composition that directs the viewer’s eye, focusing on the connection and emotional tension between them.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The painting highlights the disparities in healthcare during the late 19th century when diseases like tuberculosis claimed many lives, particularly in poorer communities. Limited access to effective medical treatments meant higher mortality rates among lower socio-economic classes. Munch's depiction is a testament to the social hardships and lack of medical support available to those of middle and lower classes during this period.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Tuberculosis, the illness depicted in "The Sick Child," is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It typically affects the lungs but can also impact other parts of the body. It spreads through airborne respiratory droplets and was a leading cause of death in Europe during the 19th century.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>In the painting, the signs of tuberculosis are hinted through the depiction of the child's pallor and frailty, alongside the somber, supportive presence of the adult figure. These details highlight the progressive wasting and lethargy associated with the disease. The melancholy tone of the artwork conveys the emotional and physical toll of chronic illness on both the patient and their family.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>During Munch’s time, the treatment of tuberculosis was limited and primarily focused on improving living conditions, rest, and nutrition. Sanatoriums provided a controlled environment that promoted recovery through rest and moderate exercise. Antibiotics revolutionized treatment in the 20th century, significantly reducing mortality rates.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Poor living conditions, malnutrition, and limited access to healthcare significantly influenced the spread and mortality of tuberculosis during the 19th century. Munch's work addresses these challenges, emphasizing the intersection of art, health, and societal factors. Economic status and living environments played a fundamental role in shaping health outcomes during this period.</p>
