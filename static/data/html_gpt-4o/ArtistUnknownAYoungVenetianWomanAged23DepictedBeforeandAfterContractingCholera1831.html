        <h1>A Young Venetian Woman Aged 23 Depicted Before and After Contracting Cholera (1831)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        <p>The creator of this artwork is unknown, reflecting a common issue in the historical documentation of medical illustrations. These artworks were often produced by those with specialized skill sets, such as medical professionals or anatomists, who had artistic training, but their works often went unsigned and uncredited.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This artwork dates back to 1831, during the height of the second cholera pandemic that swept through Europe. The period was marked by a lack of understanding of how cholera spread, leading to high mortality rates and widespread fear. The depiction of disease in art served both educational purposes and as a visual testament to the suffering caused by the epidemic.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The juxtaposition of the healthy and diseased states of the woman highlights the devastating impact of cholera. The left side of the image, depicting health, contrasts starkly with the right, which symbolizes suffering and decline. This use of dual imagery effectively communicates the abrupt and severe nature of choleralytic transformation.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The illustration employs symmetry and direct comparison to emphasize transformation. The careful attention to detail in the rendering of facial expressions and skin tone offers an emotional depth that enhances the educational impact. The realistic style conforms to the anatomical accuracy necessary for medical illustrations of the period.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The cholera pandemics highlighted stark social inequities, as the disease disproportionately affected impoverished communities with poor sanitation. The lack of access to clean water and adequate medical care among lower socio-economic groups intensified their vulnerability, a disparity that artworks like this unintentionally document.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>. It is characterized by acute diarrhea and dehydration, often leading to severe dehydration and death if untreated. It spreads through contaminated water and food, a pathway not understood during the 19th century.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The artwork vividly depicts the physiological consequences of cholera. The woman's gaunt appearance and pallor on the right side signify severe dehydration and hypoxia, common symptoms as the body rapidly loses fluids and electrolytes. These visual cues were instrumental in early medical education and public understanding.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the 1830s, treatment for cholera was rudimentary and often ineffective, due to a lack of understanding of its causes. Common practices included bloodletting and the use of purgatives. It wasn't until the late 19th century that the importance of rehydration was recognized, significantly improving survival rates.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The spread of cholera was heavily influenced by social determinants, including inadequate infrastructure, unsanitary living conditions, and limited access to medical care. The epidemic forced many cities to reassess public health policies and invest in better water and sewage systems, an early step in modern public health reforms.</p>
