        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork "The Lady of Shalott" was painted by John William Waterhouse, a prominent figure associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood’s later phase. Waterhouse, an English painter, was renowned for his depictions of classical mythology and literary themes, often combining contemporary events with elements of romanticism and realism.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Completed in 1888, "The Lady of Shalott" captures the Victorian fascination with medievalism and Arthurian legends—a central theme in the arts and literature of the 19th century. This period was marked by a resurgence in interest in the chivalric ideals and romantic narratives associated with the Middle Ages, as Victorian society reflected on the tension between industrial progress and the longing for a pastoral past.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting illustrates a scene from Alfred Tennyson's narrative poem "The Lady of Shalott," which tells the tragic tale of a cursed maiden confined to a tower. The Lady’s expression and posture, set against a backdrop of lush natural elements, symbolize her sorrow and yearning for freedom, as she resigns to her fate. Waterhouse utilizes a rich palette and vivid details to imbue the scene with symbolic elements, such as the candles symbolizing life’s fleeting nature.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Waterhouse employs a blend of meticulous detail and fluid strokes to bring the narrative to life. Noteworthy is his use of light and shadow, which creates a dramatic contrast and emphasizes the emotional gravity of the scene. The composition harmoniously balances rich colors and textures, showcasing the natural setting and opulent drapery, enhancing the thematic intensity.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The Lady of Shalott serves as a reflection on the position of women during the Victorian era, illustrating themes of isolation and restricted agency. It highlights the constraints imposed on women who were often romanticized in literature and art, yet remained trapped by societal limitations, symbolized by the Lady’s inability to control her destiny.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The Lady of Shalott is depicted as succumbing to an ambiguous, curse-like condition, perceived through the lens of psychological and metaphorical illness. Psychologically, her condition parallels the symptoms of depression and despair due to prolonged isolation, resonating with Victorian notions of illness as a moral and existential crisis.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Signifiers of the Lady's despair are evident in her vacant expression and the somber atmosphere. Her posture and pale complexion represent sickness and a surrender to her fate, visually articulating the symptoms of her 'illness' established by Tennyson’s narrative — a metaphoric embodiment of societal and personal entrapment.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the narrative, there is no cure for the Lady’s curse—symbolizing the fatalistic view of destiny. However, one might consider that breaking free from the constraints—embodied metaphorically by the mirror—represents an act of agency that Victorian society seldom permitted women, thus rendering her ‘treatment’ as an act of tragic defiance.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The depiction of the Lady’s predicament speaks volumes of the societal expectations and pressures of the era. Victorian ideals of love, honor, and duty confined women within roles of passivity and compliance. Her illness—of both physical and metaphorical nature—is a direct reflection of these social constructs.</p>
