        <h2>Manuel Gomez Morenoy Gonzalez: Saint John of God Saves the Sick of the Royal Hospital in Granada from the Fire (1880)</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Manuel Gomez Morenoy Gonzalez was a Spanish painter known for his historical and religious subjects, often highlighting the narrative power of his compositions. With a masterful command over color and form, his works were deeply entrenched in realism, capturing the emotional and spiritual essence of the scenes he depicted.</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>The painting was created in 1880, a period characterized by a resurgence of interest in national history and religious themes in Spain. During this time, Spain was undergoing social and political changes, grappling with modernity while reconnecting with its historical roots through art that emphasized traditional values and heroic figures.</p>
        
        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The artwork depicts Saint John of God, a Portuguese soldier turned healthcare worker and later canonized saint. The painting symbolizes divine intervention and compassion, portraying Saint John in an act of heroism as he saves the sick during a fire. The play of light around the saint signifies holiness and courage, a common thematic representation in religious iconography.</p>
        
        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>Morenoy Gonzalez’s use of dramatic lighting and realistic detail is notable. The dynamic composition, the delicate rendering of emotions, and the careful structuring of space contribute to the painting's narrative depth. The principles of contrast and emphasis are clearly evident, drawing the viewer’s eye to the central figure amid the chaos.</p>
        
        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Saint John’s actions underline the inequities faced by the marginalized sick, illustrating how compassion transcends social barriers. In a broader context, the artwork emphasizes the historical neglect of the vulnerable, prompting reflection on the systems that perpetuate inequality in healthcare access.</p>
        
        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>While the artwork does not specify a disease, the setting at a hospital suggests epidemics common in 16th-century Spain, such as smallpox or tuberculosis. These diseases were rampant, often exacerbated by poor living conditions and inadequate medical knowledge.</p>
        
        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The ill individuals in the painting show signs of distress and physical debility, typical of patients suffering from serious ailments. These visual cues amplify the urgency and desperation inherent in the scene, reflecting the reality of medical crises during the era.</p>
        
        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>In the 16th century, treatments were rudimentary, relying on herbal remedies and limited medical procedures. Care often involved palliative measures rather than curative, emphasizing comfort due to a lack of advanced medical understanding and technology.</p>
        
        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Social factors such as poverty, overcrowding, and lack of hygiene significantly contributed to the spread of diseases. These determinants underscored the inequity in health outcomes, which were closely tied to socio-economic status and access to care.</p>
