        <h2>Bartholomew Agrate (6)</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        The statue of Saint Bartholomew flayed was created by the Italian sculptor Marco d'Agrate in 1562. Marco was part of a celebrated line of sculptors in Milan. His works are noted for their exquisite detailing and anatomical accuracy.

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        The sculpture dates back to the Renaissance period, a time notable for its revival of classical art and its emphasis on humanism. It was a time when there was significant interest in science and anatomy, reflected in the detailed representation of the human form. Milan, where the sculpture was created, was a thriving cultural hub in the 16th century.

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        Saint Bartholomew is depicted in this disturbing yet compelling form without skin, symbolizing his martyrdom. According to Christian tradition, he was flayed alive, and the sculpture captures this gruesome aspect, personifying the saint’s piety and endurance in the face of suffering.

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        Marco d'Agrate's sculpture is celebrated for its striking realism and anatomical precision. The drapery, musculature, and the saint's expression all highlight the Renaissance ideal of verisimilitude combined with emotional expressiveness. The piece serves as a dramatic engagement with the viewer through its intense detail and raw presentation.

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        During the Renaissance, there was growing tension between traditional religious narratives and the emerging scientific insights into human physiology. This sculpture embodies that dichotomy, embodying both religious reverence and the advanced anatomical knowledge of the time, which was still not accessible to all socio-economic classes.

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        While the sculpture does not depict a modern biomedical condition per se, the portrayal of flayed skin is an anatomical exaggeration that aligns with certain dermatological conditions or traumatic injuries that reveal muscular systems. In the historical context, such conditions were often misunderstood and attributed to supernatural causes.

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        The open display of musculature and veins may symbolize pathological findings associated with diseases affecting the skin or the underlying muscles. It highlights the scientific curiosity of the Renaissance period, where understanding of the body was beginning to be based on direct observation.

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        In the Renaissance era, treatments for skin and muscular conditions were rudimentary and heavily reliant on herbal remedies, religious rituals, and rudimentary surgical procedures. There was a significant reliance on traditional knowledge as scientific methods were still developing.

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        Illnesses in the Renaissance were often influenced by social and environmental factors such as sanitary conditions, access to care, and socio-economic status. Artworks like this generate dialogue on the disparity in medical knowledge and access to healthcare resources between different societal classes.
