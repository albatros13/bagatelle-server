        <h1>Giovanni Battista dell'Arte</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            Giovanni Battista dell'Arte was a notable figure associated with the cultural phenomenon of commedia dell'arte, a form of improvisational theater that emerged in Italy during the Renaissance. This form of art deeply influenced European theatrical traditions, drawing on a range of characters, societal roles, and everyday humor.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>
            Commedia dell'arte emerged in Italy in the 16th century. It was characterized by its use of stock characters and masked performers. This form of theater gained prominence against a backdrop of social and political upheaval, reflecting and responding to the dynamic changes of Renaissance Europe.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>
            The artwork's characters are archetypes, representing various societal roles such as the fool, the servant, and the master. Masks used in performances symbolized the hidden truths and multifaceted nature of human identity, serving as a social commentary on the roles people played in society.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>
            Giovanni Battista dell'Arte’s work reflects the dynamic, energetic movement typical in scenes portraying commedia dell'arte. The composition uses strong lines and vibrant colors to emphasize motion and character interaction, engaging the viewer by simulating the lively atmosphere of the performances.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            Commedia dell'arte often depicted the social hierarchies and inequities of the time through exaggerated characters and plots. These performances could be subversive, offering critiques of the aristocracy and conniving power players, thereby reflecting societal tensions and disparities in the Renaissance era.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            While the artwork itself may not explicitly center on disease, it can be understood in the context of conditions such as pellagra, a disease common in Europe due to niacin deficiency, affected by the poor diets of lower socio-economic classes.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Pellegrinaggio’s symptoms—dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia—can be subtly represented through the appearance and attire of characters symbolizing economic hardship or physical stress, depicted through the weathered clothes and sometimes tired expressions of performers.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            At the time, treatments for niacin deficiency were based on dietary improvements, although understanding was limited. Foods rich in niacin or tryptophan, such as meat and dairy, were prescribed, yet adherence varied greatly due to economic constraints.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Social determinants such as poverty, limited access to diverse food sources, and poor public health awareness contributed to widespread pellagra among lower classes. The stark division between rich and poor meant that nutritional knowledge was not readily applied across all sections of society.
