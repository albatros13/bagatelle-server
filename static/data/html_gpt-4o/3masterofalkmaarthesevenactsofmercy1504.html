        <h2>Analysis of The Seven Acts of Mercy</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The "Master of Alkmaar" is an anonymous artist or collective credited with creating a series of paintings depicting the "Seven Acts of Mercy." Although their identity remains unknown, their work is renowned for its vivid depiction of medieval life. The artist worked in the late 15th to early 16th century and was most prominent in the city of Alkmaar in the Netherlands.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>The painting was created around 1504 during the Northern Renaissance, a time when religious reformation and humanism were reshaping Europe. It was a period of significant socio-economic change and growing urbanization. The artwork depicts charitable acts, which were crucial at a time when public welfare systems were virtually nonexistent.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
        <p>The piece is rich in Christian symbolism, depicting the seven corporal acts of mercy: feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, clothing the naked, sheltering the homeless, visiting the sick, visiting prisoners, and burying the dead. Each act serves as a moral guide for Christians, representing the obligations to care for one's neighbor, a core Christian principle.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>The artwork is characterized by its use of bright colors and detailed representation typical of the Northern Renaissance. The composition balances intricate details and realistic portrayals, using perspective to create a sense of depth. The figures are animated, expressive, and placed strategically to guide the viewer through the narrative.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The acts depicted illustrate charitable ideals necessary due to widespread poverty and inequality. These paintings not only remind viewers of their moral obligations but highlight the trade-offs between wealth and destitution prevalent in the 16th century. It underscores a society dependent on individual and church charity, given the absence of structured social support systems.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>During the time of painting, diseases such as the plague, leprosy, and other infectious diseases were common. Poor living conditions, lack of hygiene, and undernutrition contributed significantly to their spread, especially in overcrowded cities.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>In the painting, some figures may show signs of illness typical of the era, such as emaciated bodies or pallor, indicating malnutrition or disease. These depictions echo the dire health conditions of the time that necessitated acts of mercy like feeding the hungry and caring for the sick.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment of diseases during the era was rudimentary, relying on herbal remedies and religious healing practices. Care was often provided by monastic hospices or through acts of community caregiving depicted in the painting, reflecting a deep connection between spirituality and medicine.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Poverty, poor sanitation, and malnutrition were key social determinants of illness. The repeated depiction of mercy acts in the painting points to a societal acknowledgment that addressing these factors was crucial for improving health outcomes.</p>
