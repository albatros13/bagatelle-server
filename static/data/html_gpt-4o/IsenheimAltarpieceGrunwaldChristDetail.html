        <h1>Isenheim Altarpiece Grunwald Christ Detail</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            The Isenheim Altarpiece was created by Matthias Grünewald, a German Renaissance painter known for his vivid and intense use of color and emotion. The altarpiece was commissioned for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim, France. Known for their care of patients suffering from skin diseases, the Antonine monks chose Grünewald for his capability to convey deep human suffering and religious themes.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time frame)</h2>
        <p>
            Created between 1512 and 1516, the Isenheim Altarpiece was made during the late Gothic period. Europe at this time was a place of religious devotion, the Plague, and various wars. The altarpiece itself was commissioned to provide solace to hospital patients, many of whom suffered from ergotism, a common disease caused by fungus-contaminated rye.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>
            The central panel of the Isenheim Altarpiece shows the crucifixion of Christ and is steeped in religious symbolism. The depiction of Christ’s crucifixion includes vivid wounds and poignant expressions of suffering, symbolizing the agony endured on behalf of humanity’s sins. Saint John, pointing to the sacrificial lamb, emphasizes salvation through suffering.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            Grünewald's work is characterized by its intense color palette, dramatic lighting, and emotive figures. The chiaroscuro technique used in the artwork starkly contrasts light and dark, highlighting the central figure of Christ. The complex composition and detailed iconography convey a narrative of sacred suffering and redemption.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            The Isenheim Altarpiece reflects the cultural and social inequities of its time. The suffering depicted mirrors the anguish of the disenfranchised and ill, particularly those forgotten by society. The artwork served as a visual comfort and educational tool for those who had limited access to literacy and formal education.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            The altarpiece is renowned for its depictions of ergotism, also known as St. Anthony’s Fire. This condition resulted from consuming rye infected with ergot fungus, leading to severe symptoms such as gangrene, hallucinations, and convulsions.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            The artwork vividly portrays the symptoms of ergotism, as shown in the lesions on Christ’s body. These serve as a reminder of the hospital’s patients’ suffering, making the altarpiece a unique intersection of religious art and medical illustration.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            During the period, treatment of ergotism was largely symptomatic, involving care provided by the Antonine monks. The focus was on easing pain and providing comfort through religious solace. Patients were encouraged to pray and participate in rituals to seek divine intervention.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Contaminated grain was often consumed by poorer populations, who relied heavily on rye for sustenance. Inadequate knowledge about hygiene and food storage exacerbated the spread of ergotism. This represented broader societal inequities related to food security and health knowledge.
