        <h1>Achilles Bandaging Patroklos</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork represents a classical piece from Ancient Greece, specifically attributed to an unknown Greek vase painter. Such images are usually linked to the pottery of the Attic region renowned for its red-figure technique. The artists were often anonymous; their works defined by style rather than individual recognition.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Dating back to the 5th century BCE, this piece reflects the intense socio-political environment of Athens, known for its dominance in art and philosophy. It was a time when Greek culture heavily emphasized heroic narratives, particularly from epic tales like Homer’s "Iliad". This influence is deeply embedded in their art, showcasing themes of heroism and camaraderie.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The depiction of Achilles bandaging Patroklos is rich in symbolism, portraying themes of friendship, care, and vulnerability in warfare. The use of heroic figures from the "Iliad" serves as iconographic elements promoting virtues of bravery and loyalty among warriors, which were pivotal during the period.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The red-figure technique exemplified here allows for greater detail and dynamism than its predecessor, the black-figure style. The composition utilizes line and contrast to highlight the tenderness of the scene, focusing on the interaction between the two figures and employing principles of balance and proportion characteristic of Greek art.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>In the socio-cultural context of Ancient Greece, such artworks subtly underline class distinctions. The depiction of aristocratic warriors reflects the societal focus on elite figures, while commoners and slaves are rarely portrayed, highlighting the disparities in representations of everyday Greek life vs. mythological or elite subjects.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The artwork illustrates a common occurrence in ancient warfare: injuries resulting from battle, here represented by a wound on Patroklos. While it does not describe a specific disease, it highlights the physical traumas soldiers endured, which were prevalent given the frequent conflicts of the period.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The bandaging depicted in the image suggests a deep understanding of the need for wound management. The attention to wrapping and supporting injuries points towards their rudimentary medical knowledge, reflecting on the physical ailments commonly faced during historic battles.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Ancient Greek medical practices focused on natural remedies and skilled bandaging, as seen here. Warriors often relied on the immediate care from companions on the battlefield, utilizing bandages made from linen. The skillful care by Achilles suggests the cultural emphasis on assisting comrades in times of need.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social factors such as status and wealth determined the level of medical attention one received. The nobles, as depicted, had greater access to care and remedies compared to lower classes, whose injuries might go untreated or improperly managed due to lack of resources.</p>
