        <h1>Art and Biomedical Analysis of "Judith and Holofernes"</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The painting "Judith and Holofernes" is a renowned work by the Italian Baroque master, Caravaggio. Known for his dramatic use of light and shadow, Caravaggio revolutionized art through his intense realism and emotionally charged subjects.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Caravaggio painted "Judith and Holofernes" around 1598-1599, during the Counter-Reformation period in Italy. This time was marked by a religious and artistic response to the Protestant Reformation. Art served as a medium for conveying religious themes more vividly to reinforce Catholic doctrine.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting depicts the biblical scene where Judith beheads Holofernes to save her people. Judith symbolizes virtue and divine intervention, while the decapitation represents triumph over tyranny. The presence of the elderly maid highlights the alliance between experience and youthful bravery.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Caravaggio’s use of chiaroscuro is a defining feature, creating stark contrasts between light and darkness that enhance the dramatic intensity. The composition directs the viewer’s focus to Judith’s determined expression and the violent act, encapsulating the Baroque fascination with movement and emotion.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting reflects the socio-cultural tensions of Caravaggio’s time. The depiction of women as central, decisive figures contrasts with prevailing patriarchal norms, suggesting an underlying commentary on gender roles within the context of religious narratives.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Notably, the figure of Holofernes exhibits a pronounced swelling at the neck, suggestive of goiter. Goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland commonly linked to iodine deficiency, highlighting a potential representation of prevalent health issues of the era.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The depiction of goiter is characterized by the swelling in the neck area of Holofernes, which may reflect Caravaggio’s keen attention to physiological details. Such elements might have been observed in the society due to common dietary insufficiencies.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Caravaggio's time, treatments for goiter were rudimentary. Remedies included dietary changes to increase iodine intake, though the understanding of thyroid function was limited. Historical treatments might have also involved herbal concoctions.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Goiter reflects socioeconomic conditions, as iodine deficiency was prevalent in areas where dietary variety was limited. The appearance of such an ailment in art highlights the intersection of health, nutrition, and social circumstances.</p>
