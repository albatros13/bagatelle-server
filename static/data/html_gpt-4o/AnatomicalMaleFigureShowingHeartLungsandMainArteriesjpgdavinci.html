        <h1>Anatomical Male Figure Showing Heart, Lungs, and Main Arteries</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork is attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, one of the most prominent figures of the Italian Renaissance. Da Vinci was a polymath whose expertise extended beyond painting to include inventions, scientific exploration, and anatomy. His anatomical studies were groundbreaking, offering unprecedented insight into the human body.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This artwork was likely created during the late 15th or early 16th century, a period marked by the Renaissance in Europe. It was an era characterized by a revival of classical learning, advancements in science, and a humanistic approach to art and culture. The period saw significant developments in understanding human anatomy, driven by renewed interest in empirical observation.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The illustration symbolizes the fusion of art and science, a hallmark of the Renaissance. It reflects an intersection where the beauty of the human form is celebrated alongside a desire for knowledge about its mechanics. The detailed depiction of internal organs highlights the importance placed on understanding life and health.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Da Vinci's work is renown for its precise line work and balanced composition. The anatomical drawings emphasize proportion and realism, integrating da Vinci's artistic skills with his scientific observations. The clarity and accuracy of the renderings continue to be admired for their artistic merit and scientific accuracy.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During the Renaissance, access to medical knowledge was primarily limited to scholars and the elite. While da Vinci's studies contributed immensely to medical science, they were not widely disseminated in his time and remained largely inaccessible to the general public, reflecting social stratification in the access to knowledge.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>In da Vinci's time, diseases were often misunderstood, with prevailing theories such as humorism. The anatomical illustration itself doesn't depict a specific disease but reveals the pathways critical for understanding cardiovascular and respiratory health, against which deviations could later be identified.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>While this illustration does not directly show signs of illness, the precise anatomical details laid the groundwork for future studies in pathology. By understanding normal anatomy through such detailed studies, later anatomists could better identify abnormalities and disease signs.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the Renaissance, treatments were rudimentary, relying on practices like bloodletting and herbal medicine. Though da Vinci's work didn't directly influence treatment methodologies of his time, it paved the way for improved anatomical understanding, eventually informing modern medical practices.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social factors such as class, education, and access to knowledge significantly influenced health outcomes during the Renaissance. The elite could access da Vinci's insights more readily than the general populace, which would have affected the disparities in health and treatment quality.</p>
