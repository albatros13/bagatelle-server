        <h1>Analysis of the Stained Glass Window: Jesus Curing the Man with Palsy</h1>

        <h2>a) Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        The artist of this stained glass window is unknown, as is the case with many similar artworks from historical churches. This artwork is part of the rich tradition of ecclesiastical art, particularly associated with the Gothic revival period.

        <h2>b) Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        This stained glass is located in the Church of Christ the Consoler in Skelton Cum Newby, North Yorkshire, England. The church was designed by renowned architect William Burges and completed between 1871 and 1876. This period saw a Gothic revival in architecture and art, representing a return to medieval styles and religious themes in reaction to industrialization.

        <h2>c) Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        The stained glass depicts a biblical scene from the New Testament where Jesus heals a man afflicted with palsy. The imagery symbolizes divine compassion, healing, and miracles. The use of halos signifies Holiness and divinity, while gestures convey mercy and benediction.

        <h2>d) Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        The composition uses vibrant color contrasts and intricate details typical of Gothic revival stained glass, emphasizing narrative clarity and spiritual impact. Symmetry and balance are achieved through the placement of figures and architectural elements, creating harmony in the scene.

        <h2>e) Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        Biblical depictions like this often address themes of marginalization and divine grace. Here, the man with palsy represents those suffering from illness and disability, who were often marginalized in historical societies. The compassionate intervention of Jesus is a call to address social injustices.

        <h2>f) Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        Palsy historically refers to conditions involving paralysis or tremors. The term encompassed various neurological disorders, potentially including cerebral palsy, Bell’s palsy, or Parkinson’s, understood differently in the past due to limited medical knowledge.

        <h2>g) Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        Symptoms such as immobility, weakness, and tremors characterized historical descriptions of palsy. In the artwork, the man's posture and pleading expression convey his ailment and dependency.

        <h2>h) Treatment</h2>
        During Biblical times, treatment options were limited, relying heavily on spiritual and miraculous intervention. Jesus’s healing is symbolic of hope for divine intervention when medical knowledge was rudimentary and treatments were inaccessible.

        <h2>i) Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Factors contributing to conditions like palsy included poor nutrition, lack of healthcare access, and socioeconomic status. These determinants reflect the historical and ongoing inequities affecting health outcomes.
