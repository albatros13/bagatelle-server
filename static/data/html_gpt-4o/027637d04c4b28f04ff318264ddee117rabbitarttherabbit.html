        <h1>The Rabbit: A Historical and Medical Exploration</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork titled "The Rabbit" is believed to have been created by an anonymous artist or group that draws inspiration from folk-art traditions. Though specific information about the creator is not available, the art style suggests influence from medieval European iconography, typically seen in tarot cards and mythological illustrations.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>This piece can be situated within a broader framework of tarot symbolism, which gained significant popularity in Europe during the Renaissance. Tarot cards often included allegorical imagery, serving as both entertainment and divination tools. The fool, depicted as a playful character, represents the potential for new beginnings and innocence.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The rabbit, traditionally a symbol of fertility and abundance, is juxtaposed with the jester’s hat typically worn by ‘The Fool.’ This iconography cleverly links concepts of innocence, curiosity, and the beginning of a journey. The rabbit's dance portrays the balance between spontaneity and folly.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Visually, the artwork echoes a whimsical, naive style. The composition utilizes earthy tones and simple line work, echoing folk art aesthetics. The use of dynamic pose gives a sense of motion and liveliness, emphasizing elements like rhythm and movement, and employing balance through the centered placement of the rabbit.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During the Renaissance, the use of tarot as a divinatory tool was often restricted to higher societal classes due to the literacy and leisure time required for such practices. The Fool card itself often represented those marginalized by societal norms, reflecting the class disparities of the time.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Interestingly, rabbits are often associated with diseases like tularemia, a bacterial infection that can be transmitted to humans. Tularemia is caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis, and the symbolism of the rabbit in this artwork could be interpreted allegorically to discuss contamination and purity.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In medical illustrations, rabbits might represent potential carriers of disease. Signs of tularemia in animals include fever, skin ulcers, and swollen lymph glands. In the context of the artwork, the healthy appearance of the rabbit might symbolize overcoming illness or the hidden nature of carriers.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Tularemia in humans requires antibiotic treatment, typically with streptomycin or gentamicin. Early diagnosis is crucial, as untreated tularemia can lead to severe complications. The use of antibiotics revolutionized the management of such bacterial infections, reducing mortality significantly.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Access to medical care and public health infrastructure significantly affect the spread and treatment of diseases like tularemia. Historical disparities in healthcare access have often left rural communities more vulnerable to zoonotic diseases, perpetuating cycles of poverty and illness.</p>
