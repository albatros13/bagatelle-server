        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis: Charles Eisenmann’s Portrait of Myrtle Corbin</h1>
        
        <h2>a. Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The photographic portrait was taken by Charles Eisenmann, a well-known photographer in the late 19th century. His work predominantly covered unique and unusual figures, often capturing subjects who performed in circus sideshows or were labeled as "freaks" during that era.</p>

        <h2>b. Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Charles Eisenmann was active during the late 1800s, a period marked by the height of the American circus and sideshow culture. These events were immensely popular as forms of entertainment, often showcasing individuals with rare medical conditions or extraordinary talents.</p>

        <h2>c. Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>This photograph features Myrtle Corbin, famously known as the “Four-Legged Girl.” Such imagery often symbolized the broader cultural fascination and commodification of medical anomalies during the Victorian era. The presence of additional limbs is a striking visual juxtaposition of normalcy and rarity.</p>

        <h2>d. Stylistic Significance (elements of art/principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Stylistically, Eisenmann’s image employs the Victorian portrait style, characterized by formal posing and solemn expressions. The use of sepia tones and the careful framing of Myrtle’s figure highlight both her person and her physical condition, emphasizing her as the focal point.</p>

        <h2>e. Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The image provides insight into the exploitation faced by individuals with disabilities at the time. While performers like Myrtle earned a living through exhibitions, they were also subjected to public scrutiny and dehumanization due to their conditions, highlighting significant social inequities.</p>

        <h2>f. Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Myrtle Corbin was born with a rare congenital condition known as dipygus, resulting in the duplication of her lower body. This happens early in embryonic development due to abnormal axial splitting, leading to the presence of extra limbs.</p>

        <h2>g. Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The primary visible sign of Myrtle’s condition is the additional pair of limbs. Dipygus can also affect internal organs and skeletal structure, with potential complications arising from the unconventional arrangement of muscles and nerves.</p>

        <h2>h. Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Myrtle Corbin’s lifetime, medical interventions for such conditions were limited. Treatments typically focused on symptom management and maintaining mobility and comfort. Significant surgical corrections were rarely attempted due to high risk.</p>

        <h2>i. Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Socioeconomic status and access to healthcare heavily influenced the lives of individuals with rare conditions like dipygus. Myrtle Corbin’s ability to leverage her condition for financial gain was an exception rather than the rule, underscoring disparities in opportunity and healthcare access.</p>
