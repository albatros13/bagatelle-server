        <h1>Art Historical and Medical Analysis of "Salvator Mundi"</h1>

        <section>
            <strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</strong>
            <p>Leonardo da Vinci, one of the most renowned figures of the Italian Renaissance, painted "Salvator Mundi" (meaning "Savior of the World"). His work, which spans multiple disciplines, reflects his mastery in painting, as well as his contributions to various scientific fields.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</strong>
            <p>"Salvator Mundi" was created around the year 1500 during the High Renaissance, a period characterized by innovative approaches to visual arts driven by artists like Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael. This was a time of increasing interest in naturalism and humanism throughout Europe.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <strong>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</strong>
            <p>The painting depicts Christ as the world's savior. His right hand is raised in blessing, while his left holds a transparent globe, symbolizing celestial spheres and eternal dominion. The use of such symbols was intended to communicate powerful theological messages.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</strong>
            <p>Leonardo’s rendering uses chiaroscuro to great effect, enhancing the depth and volume of the subject’s form. The smooth gradations of light and shadow create a life-like presence, evident in the face and hands, inviting viewers into a contemplative engagement with the painting.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</strong>
            <p>Within the socio-cultural context of the Renaissance, art was often a commission by affluent patrons, thus accessible predominantly to the elite. The themes and depictions, including that of "Salvator Mundi," were aligned with religious and cultural ideals prevalent among these wealthy patrons.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</strong>
            <p>Exotropia, a form of strabismus where the eyes turn outward, is evident in the depiction of Christ in "Salvator Mundi." This condition can be congenital or develop due to nervous or muscular issues affecting the eyes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</strong>
            <p>In this artwork, Christ's gaze is slightly misaligned, which appears as an artistic encoding of exotropia. Such details may have been unintentional, reflective of Leonardo’s chronicling of human imperfections observed in real life.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <strong>[h] Treatment</strong>
            <p>During Leonardo's time, the understanding and treatment of ocular conditions such as exotropia were limited. Modern treatments include vision therapy, corrective lenses, or surgery depending on severity and impact on vision.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</strong>
            <p>Access to advanced medical care, education, and overall awareness about ocular health contribute significantly to the diagnosis and treatment of conditions like exotropia. Social and economic status often influence the quality and timeliness of healthcare that individuals receive.</p>
