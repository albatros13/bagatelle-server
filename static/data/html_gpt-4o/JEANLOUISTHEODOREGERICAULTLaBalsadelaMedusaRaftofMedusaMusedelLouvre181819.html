        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis of "Raft of the Medusa"</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The painting "Raft of the Medusa" is a monumental work by the French artist Théodore Géricault. Regarded as an essential figure in the Romantic movement, Géricault is known for his dynamic compositions and exploration of contemporary events. His works often convey intense emotional depth and are considered significant contributions to 19th-century art.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created between 1818 and 1819, "Raft of the Medusa" reflects a tumultuous period in French history post-Napoleonic Wars. Géricault painted it shortly after a shipwreck caused by the incompetence of a politically-appointed captain. The piece is a critique of the restored French monarchy under King Louis XVIII, exposing governmental neglect and its devastating consequences.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting is rife with symbolism. The raft itself, filled with desperate survivors, symbolizes human suffering and survival against insurmountable odds. The figure raising a cloth towards the horizon signifies hope, while the sea around them represents nature’s formidable and indifferent power. Géricault meticulously studied corpses to achieve realism, symbolizing death's omnipresence.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The dramatic use of light and shadow, along with intense color contrasts, highlights the emotional charge of the scene. Géricault’s composition uses a pyramid structure, drawing the eye towards the group of survivors hailing for rescue. The tumultuous waves and dynamic human forms embody the movement’s pathos and drama, hallmark traits of Romanticism.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting highlights the incompetence and moral failings of those in power, a critique of the post-revolutionary social structure. The tragic story narrates inequality, as those left to perish were mostly lower class and marginalized. The painting serves as a political commentary on exploitation and neglect by aristocratic rulers.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Géricault's extensive research depicted the outbreak of contagious diseases like scurvy and dehydration among the survivors, worsened by lack of water and hygiene. Moreover, the graphic depiction of cannibalism reflects extreme malnutrition and starvation during their ordeal.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The emaciated human forms and sunken faces in the painting indicate severe malnutrition and dehydration. Infected wounds and pallor suggest immune system deterioration due to a lack of essential nutrients. These signs underscore the ordeal’s severe psychological and physical toll.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>No treatment was available during their voyage; the survivors relied on makeshift solutions like collected rainwater. After rescue, they would have needed rehydration, nourishment, and treatment for infections. The lack of immediate medical intervention led to numerous deaths at sea.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Socio-economic status played a crucial role in the tragedy. Political corruption and negligence created dire conditions aboard the Medusa. The survivors’ plight reflects broader socio-political inequalities where access to life-saving resources was starkly lacking, contributing to unnecessary suffering and loss of life.</p>
