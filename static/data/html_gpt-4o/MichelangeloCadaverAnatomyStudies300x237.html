        <h2>Michelangelo Cadaver Anatomy Studies</h2>
        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe:</strong></p>
        <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti, a pivotal figure of the Italian Renaissance, was renowned not only for his artistic prowess but also for his profound interest in human anatomy. His anatomical studies, often conducted through dissections of cadavers, laid the groundwork for his masterpieces in sculpture and painting, such as the "David" and the Sistine Chapel ceiling.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame):</strong></p>
        <p>Michelangelo's anatomical studies emerged during the Renaissance, a period of renewed interest in classical antiquity and humanism in the 15th and 16th centuries. This era marked a departure from medieval scholasticism and emphasized empirical observation, which was reflected in the artistic and scientific pursuits of the time.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography:</strong></p>
        <p>In Michelangelo's anatomy drawings, the human body is depicted with an unprecedented attention to detail and realism. The exposure of muscles and sinews symbolizes a quest for understanding human nature and the divine proportions that underpin creation, aligning with the Renaissance belief in the interconnectedness of art and science.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design):</strong></p>
        <p>Michelangelo's anatomical sketches exhibit a masterful use of line and form. His studies reveal a dynamic tension and movement, showcasing an intricate balance between accuracy and expressive artistry. The emphasis on musculature and structure in these drawings reflects a keen observation of the human form, reinforcing his famous sculptural work.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities:</strong></p>
        <p>The practice of dissection during the Renaissance was often restricted to privileged individuals associated with academic or religious institutions. Michelangelo's access to cadavers for dissection reflects societal hierarchies and the limited opportunities for scientific exploration available to the general populace at the time.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology:</strong></p>
        <p>While Michelangelo's anatomical studies primarily focus on the structure of the healthy human body, they inadvertently contribute to biomedical understanding by offering detailed visual references. In doing so, these works underscore the Renaissance shift toward a more scientific approach to medicine, diverging from superstitious explanations of disease.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness:</strong></p>
        <p>The detailed representation of human anatomy in Michelangelo’s studies allows physicians of the time to better recognize deviations from normal structure, identifying signs of illnesses, injuries, or congenital abnormalities. This anatomical accuracy provides a foundation for diagnosing various conditions.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[h] Treatment:</strong></p>
        <p>During the Renaissance, medical treatment was largely based on the humoral theory. Michelangelo’s anatomical studies, however, represented a movement towards more empirical and observational methods, paving the way for advancements in surgical techniques and anatomical knowledge that informed medical treatments.</p>
        
        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness:</strong></p>
        <p>The Renaissance era witnessed widening disparities between social classes, impacting access to health care and nutritious food. Michelangelo’s involvement in scientific anatomical studies also signifies the cultural capital associated with knowledge, highlighting the divide in educational opportunities available to different social strata.</p>
