        <h1>Art and Medical Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork on the left is credited to Dr. John E. Wolf, Jr., representing a medical illustration of neurofibromatosis and its variations, labeled as "La Lepra et Elephantiasis." The portrait on the right is the work of an unknown artist from the late 16th century and depicts the famous navigator Sir Francis Drake.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>The neurofibromatosis illustration, presumably from the late 20th century, offers scholarly insight into the disease, reflecting an era of advancing biomedical knowledge. The portrait of Sir Francis Drake dates back to 1581, encapsulating the Elizabethan era's socio-political climate, exploration, and colonialism.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The medical illustration uses its subjects to convey symptoms and variations of neurofibromatosis, serving an educational and diagnostic purpose, emphasizing the medical challenges faced by those afflicted. The portrait of Drake signifies power and maritime prowess, denoted by the globe, armor, and aristocratic posture.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The medical illustration employs detailed linework and anatomical accuracy, focusing on clarity and educational purposes. The portrait of Drake employs rich color contrasts, texture, and symmetry to convey elegance and nobility, characteristic of Elizabethan portraiture.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The medical depiction highlights the stigmatization and societal challenges faced by individuals with visible diseases. It reflects on historical and ongoing socio-cultural inequities concerning health and accessibility to medical care. The portrait of Drake, on the other hand, represents the disparities of power, wealth, and status during the Elizabethan period.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder primarily characterized by the formation of tumors on nerve tissue. It stems from mutations in the NF1 or NF2 genes, often leading to skin changes and, in some cases, other neurological and developmental implications.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Symptoms depicted include numerous café-au-lait spots, skin neurofibromas, and, in severe cases, skeletal deformities or large tumors, all indicating the progress of the disease. Such illustrations aid in the visual understanding of the disorder's wide range of presentations.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment primarily focuses on managing symptoms and complications and may involve surgical removal of painful or disfiguring tumors, radiation therapy, and in some cases, chemotherapy for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Genetic counseling is also often recommended for affected families.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors influencing the impact and management of neurofibromatosis include socioeconomic status, access to healthcare services, public awareness, and educational resources. Stigma and lack of understanding are common social challenges impacting patient quality of life.</p>
