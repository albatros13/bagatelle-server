        <h2>Theodore Gericault - Portrait of a Child Snatcher (1822)</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe:</strong><br>
            Theodore Gericault, a seminal figure in French Romanticism, is renowned for his powerful and emotive works. He was born in 1791 and demonstrated an extraordinary ability to capture human emotion and drama through his masterful use of color and form. Gericault's works often explored themes of heroism, suffering, and mental illness, reflecting his intense and innovative approach to art.
        </p>

            <strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame):</strong><br>
            The painting "Portrait of a Child Snatcher" was completed in 1822, a time when Europe was grappling with the profound effects of the Industrial Revolution. This period witnessed significant social upheaval, with reforms in labor laws and the emergence of new social classes. Gericault's work is often seen as a reaction against the industrial age’s inhumane aspects, challenging the viewer to confront the darker side of humanity and its implications.
        </p>

            <strong>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography:</strong><br>
            In this work, the depiction of a "child snatcher" could symbolize the threat to innocence and the societal fears of the era. This figure, with menacing features, may represent broader concerns about moral decay and the loss of traditional values amidst rapid industrial and social change. Gericault uses dark tones to enhance the figure's sinister demeanor, reminding viewers of the lurking dangers in society.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design):</strong><br>
            Gericault's use of chiaroscuro—a stark contrast between light and dark—is evident in this painting, enhancing the dramatic impact of the image. The somber palette intensifies the work's emotional depth, while the painterly brushstrokes create a sense of immediacy and tension. Gericault's skillful composition draws the viewer's attention to the psychological complexity of the figure displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities:</strong><br>
            This portrait underscores the pervasive social anxieties of the time, particularly concerning class struggles and moral decay. The Industrial Revolution brought about significant disparities between the rich and the poor, often reflected in art. Gericault’s critique of these inequities is implied in the depiction of marginalized figures and the unsettling atmosphere they embody.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology:</strong><br>
            The figure's gaunt appearance and hollow eyes can symbolize mental illness, possibly schizophrenia or severe depression. The etiology may stem from malnutrition, stress, and environmental factors, prevalent issues during the rapid urbanization of the 19th century.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness:</strong><br>
            The physical depiction of this figure shows signs of neglect and psychological disturbance: sunken cheeks, erratic gaze, and a withdrawn demeanor. These attributes suggest severe psychological stress or psychiatric disorders, which Gericault aimed to bring attention to as part of broader social commentary.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[h] Treatment:</strong><br>
            During the 19th century, treatments for mental illnesses were rudimentary and often inhumane, including isolation and various forms of physical restraint. The period began to see slight advancements with the introduction of moral therapy, emphasizing compassionate care and the alleviation of stress through improved living conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness:</strong><br>
            Poverty, poor living conditions, and rapid urbanization contributed significantly to mental health issues during the 19th century. These factors exacerbated the prevalence of psychological disorders, as depicted in Gericault's somber human subjects.
