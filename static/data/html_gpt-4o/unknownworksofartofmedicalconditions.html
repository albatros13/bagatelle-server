        <h1>Unknown Works of Art of Medical Conditions</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artist of this work is unknown, yet the rendering style suggests a 19th-century European origin. The intricate detailing hints at an understanding of medical illustration common in that time.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>During the 19th century, the intersection of art and medicine became increasingly pronounced. This was a period marked by advances in medical science, largely due to the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution, which facilitated deeper inquiry into human anatomy and pathology.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>This artwork showcases symbolism in the depiction of a grave medical condition. The exaggerated facial swelling may symbolize the unknown and misunderstood aspects of illness during the era, highlighting the artist’s intent to capture medical anomalies as both scientific inquiries and artistic expressions.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The use of line and shading indicates a technique aimed at realism and detail. The balance between light and shadow demonstrates chiaroscuro, lending a three-dimensional quality to the subject. Proportion is exaggerated to emphasize the medical condition, focusing the viewer’s attention.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During this era, access to healthcare was largely limited to the affluent. The portrayal might reflect societal biases where certain medical conditions were often highlighted as curiosities rather than subjects of empathy and medical intervention, perpetuating stigmas associated with visible diseases.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The image appears to depict a severe case of facial fibromatosis or cystic growth. These conditions can originate due to genetic factors or infections exacerbated by poor health conditions prevalent in the 19th century.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Visible signs include significant facial distortion and swelling, which are potential indicators of fibrous tissue overgrowth or a benign tumor. Such manifestations were typically documented in medical texts to aid in the study and understanding of rare conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment at the time would have been rudimentary, given the lack of advanced medical technologies. Procedures could have included surgical intervention, though with unpredictable outcomes. The era lacked antibiotics, complicating postoperative recovery.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as limited access to medical care, poor nutrition, and inadequate living conditions would have contributed to the development and exacerbation of such medical conditions. This reflects the broader societal health inequities of the time.</p>
