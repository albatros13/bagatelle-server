        <h1>Edvard Munch: The Sick Child (1885)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Edvard Munch (1863-1944) was a Norwegian artist whose work is renowned for its psychological depth and emotional resonance. Known as a pioneer of the Expressionist movement, Munch's body of work encapsulates his exploration of psychological themes and personal experiences.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 1885, "The Sick Child" reflects the late 19th-century fascination with emotive content in art. Europe during this period was experiencing rapid industrialization and urbanization, which often led to social upheaval and a focus on health and illness. These themes are echoed in Munch's painting, inspired by the childhood memory of his sister's illness and eventual death from tuberculosis.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>"The Sick Child" is steeped in symbolism and iconography, focusing on themes of illness, mortality, and the fragility of life. The blurred depiction of the child and the concentrated expression of the adults represent the fleeting nature of life and the grief of impending loss. Munch's use of color, with subdued tones, enhances the sense of melancholy and despair.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Munch employed a semi-impressionistic style with loose brushwork and muted color palettes to convey the emotional gravity of the scene. His departure from realism marked a transition towards Expressionism, characterized by an emphasis on representing emotional experiences rather than physical reality. The composition's simplicity and lack of detail draw focus to the emotional tension and highlight the painting's affective power.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>"The Sick Child" subtly comments on the social and cultural inequities of the time. Illness in the 19th century often highlighted the disparities in access to healthcare and the differences in the quality of life among various social classes. Tuberculosis, in particular, was a disease that affected all strata of society but underscored the vulnerabilities of those in poorer living conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The artwork deals with tuberculosis, a prevalent and deadly disease in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs but capable of spreading to other organs. The etiology involves person-to-person transmission through airborne particles expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In "The Sick Child," signs of tuberculosis include the portrayed child's weakened and pale appearance, reflecting fatigue and fever, common symptoms of the illness. The depiction of sadness and despair among family members is indicative of the emotional and psychological toll that such a pervasive disease takes on both patients and caregivers.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Munch's time, tuberculosis treatment was rudimentary and largely ineffective, relying on rest, a healthy diet, and exposure to fresh air in sanatoriums. With no effective antibiotics until the mid-20th century, many patients succumbed to the disease. Modern treatment involves a regimen of antibiotics over several months, which has significantly reduced mortality rates.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The prevalence of tuberculosis during the 19th century was heavily influenced by social determinants such as poverty, overcrowding, and poor nutrition. These factors facilitated the spread of the disease and exacerbated health inequities. Even today, tuberculosis remains more common in developing regions or among underprivileged populations.</p>
