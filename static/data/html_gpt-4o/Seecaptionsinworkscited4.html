        <h1>Art and Biomedical Analysis</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The first artwork, "The Temptation of St. Anthony," was created by Matthias Grünewald, a prominent German Renaissance painter known for his expressive and dramatic style. The other pieces include a portrait of Aubrey Beardsley, an English illustrator and author, and a diptych by Piero della Francesca portraying the Duke and Duchess of Urbino, a hallmark of the Italian Renaissance.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Grünewald's work dates back to 1512, a time characterized by religious turmoil and artistic expression driven by devout spirituality. Beardsley's portrait from 1895 reflects a period where art was increasingly exploratory, pushing boundaries in both expression and thematics. Piero della Francesca's portraits from 1465 reflect the height of the Italian Renaissance when there was a revival of classical humanistic values and a focus on realism in art.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>"The Temptation of St. Anthony" illustrates religious struggle and ascetic suffering, with creatures symbolizing inner turmoil and demonic temptation. Beardsley’s portrait hints at the aesthetic extremism and decadent elegance prominent in the late Victorian era. The portraits of the Duke and Duchess emphasize status and power, with iconography such as attire and background indicative of their social stature.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Grünewald’s composition in "The Temptation of St. Anthony" is characterized by dramatic contrast, intricate detail, and the surreal portrayal of human and supernatural forms. Piero della Francesca’s pieces are celebrated for their geometric accuracy, symmetry, and the use of perspective. Beardsley’s portrait engages simplification and unity, employing forms in harmony with the surrounding detail.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>These artworks present disparities prevalent in their eras: religious persecution and witch hunts during Grünewald’s time, the stringent societal expectations in Beardsley’s Victorian England, and the class distinctions evident in Renaissance portraits highlighting wealth and power dynamics.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The artworks also serve as studies of dermatological conditions: "The Temptation of St. Anthony" may allude to ergotism, historically known as St. Anthony's Fire. Beardsley’s portrayal echoes the depiction of pigmentary skin changes, while Piero’s pieces possibly indicate benign nevi in their subjects.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In Grünewald's piece, signs of skin eruptions and gangrenous extremities can be linked to ergotism. Beardsley’s illustration exhibits pale skin with potential pigment alterations, reflective of tuberculosis as speculated in Beardsley’s life. The presence of nevi, as seen in the Duke and Duchess, might suggest benign dermatological conditions.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Grünewald’s era, ergotism had limited treatment, often involving prayer and relic rituals attributed to Saint Anthony. In the Renaissance, treatment of skin ailments was rudimentary, primarily focusing on herbal remedies. In Beardsley’s time, while medicine improved, tuberculosis remained largely untreatable until the antibiotic era.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Environmental factors such as diet and climate contributed to diseases like ergotism. Stigmatization and limited knowledge impacted the treatment of skin conditions throughout history. High society in the Renaissance, as depicted by Piero, often had access to better nutrition and healthcare, contrasting with poorer communities.</p>
