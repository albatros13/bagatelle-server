        <h2>Analysis of "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" by Vincent van Gogh</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist</h3>
        <p>Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter whose work is characterized by bold colors and dramatic, expressive brushwork. Van Gogh is among the most famous and influential figures in Western art history.</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h3>
        <p>Painted in 1890, "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" is one of Van Gogh's final works before his death. It reflects both his personal struggles and the evolving dynamics of late 19th-century European society. The painting was created during a time when Van Gogh was under the care of Dr. Paul Gachet in Auvers-sur-Oise, France.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and Iconography</h3>
        <p>The painting captures Dr. Gachet with a melancholic expression, his head resting on his hand, symbolizing empathy and shared anguish. The inclusion of foxglove flowers, used in medicine, particularly for heart conditions, implies Gachet's medical profession and Van Gogh's interest in the interrelation of art and medicine.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance</h3>
        <p>Van Gogh's technique in this painting is characterized by vigorous brushstrokes and a vivid color palette that conveys emotion. His use of swirling lines and textured patterns showcases the post-impressionist emphasis on emotional resonance over realistic representation.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The late 19th century was a period marked by rising social awareness yet also intense inequality. Van Gogh's interactions with medical professionals like Dr. Gachet highlight the limited understanding of mental illness at the time, affecting treatment accessibility across different social strata.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Dr. Gachet was known for treating mental illnesses, and Van Gogh was suffering from severe depression. The painting indirectly addresses the psychological dimensions and stigmatization of mental health conditions during this period.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Signs of Van Gogh's turbulent psychological state are perceptible in the painting's emotive style and somber aura. The portrait’s mood reflects Van Gogh’s personal struggles with mental health, evoking a sense of empathy for the subject’s own contemplative sadness.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>In Van Gogh’s time, treatment for mental illness was limited and frequently ineffective. Dr. Gachet, though sympathetic and supportive, often employed rudimentary treatments such as rest, diet, and herbal remedies like digitalis extracted from foxglove, which appear in the artwork.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Factors including poverty, isolation, and cultural misconceptions about mental illness contributed to Van Gogh's deteriorating mental state. As a struggling artist, his financial and social hardships were pivotal in shaping his health and outlook.</p>
