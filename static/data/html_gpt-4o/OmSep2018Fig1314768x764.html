        <h1>Art and Medicine: An Analysis of Historical Illustrations</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        The artwork in question includes illustrations by artists such as Petrus Gonsalvus and Tilesius WG, who contributed to artistic and scientific renderings capturing unique medical conditions. Gonsalvus's depiction is found in the Museum of Art History in Vienna, while Tilesius's work is housed in the Lindenau-Museum in Altenburg.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        These artworks date back to the late 16th and early 19th centuries, highlighting how medical anomalies were perceived during these periods. Petrus Gonsalvus, known as the 'Werewolf of Tenerife,' lived in the late 1500s, when such medical conditions sparked curiosity and often fascination mixed with fear. By the time of Tilesius's work in the early 1800s, there was a growing scientific interest in documenting and studying rare diseases.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        The symbolism in these artworks often ties back to broader themes of human diversity and the unknown. Gonsalvus's depiction reflects themes of otherness and perhaps exclusion from societal norms. Similarly, Tilesius’s portrayal of the "Porcupine Man" with ichthyosis hystrix signifies not only a medical condition but also the uniqueness of human conditions bridled with layers of scientific exploration.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        The stylistic significance of these pieces lies in their intricate detail revealing both the artistry and scientific curiosity of the time. Gonsalvus’s portrait emphasizes realism combined with somber tones, reflecting seriousness and dignity. Tilesius’s print, rich in texture and fine line work, serves both an artistic and educational function, illustrating scales and texture of the skin condition vividly.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        The portrayal of individuals with unique medical conditions highlights social and cultural inequities. During these times, individuals with rare conditions were often marginalized or displayed as curiosities. The lack of medical understanding and the social stigma attached furthered societal inequities.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        The artworks highlight two distinct conditions: Ambras syndrome and ichthyosis hystrix. Ambras, portrayed by Gonsalvus, is characterized by excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis), caused by a genetic mutation. Ichthyosis hystrix, depicted by Tilesius, manifests as severe scaling of the skin due to mutations affecting skin cell turnover and keratinization.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        In Gonsalvus’s portrayal, thick hair covering the face and body signifies Ambras syndrome. For ichthyosis hystrix, illustrated by Tilesius, the skin’s scaly, rough appearance is indicative of dysfunction in skin shedding and keratin.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        Historically, treatments were rudimentary, often relying on symptomatic relief. Ambras syndrome might involve hair removal techniques, while ichthyosis could be managed by emollients and keratolytic agents to reduce scaling. Today, both conditions require genetic counseling and advanced dermal therapies.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Factors such as societal perception, access to medical care, and stigma played significant roles in the lives of those affected. During the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods, these determinants often influenced a person’s social status and quality of life.
