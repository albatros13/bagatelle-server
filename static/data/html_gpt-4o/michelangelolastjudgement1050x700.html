        <h1>The Last Judgement by Michelangelo</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti, an illustrious figure of the Renaissance, was the artist behind the iconic fresco, "The Last Judgement." Known for his unparalleled skill in painting, sculpture, and architecture, Michelangelo was a pivotal force in the Italian Renaissance. His work exemplifies the humanist values of the period, infusing religious themes with a profound understanding of human anatomy and emotion.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The Last Judgement was created during the years 1536 to 1541, a time when the Renaissance was deeply impacting European art and culture. Commissioned by Pope Clement VII and later completed under Pope Paul III, the fresco reflects the religious and political tensions of the Reformation era. The Catholic Church was facing significant challenges from Protestant reformers, leading to a counter-reformation which sought to reaffirm Catholic doctrine and display its spiritual authority through magnificent works of art.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The fresco is rich with symbolic imagery depicting the Second Coming of Christ and the final judgment of souls. Christ is centrally positioned, surrounded by saints, angels, and the resurrected dead, embodying the notions of divine justice and hope for salvation. The inclusion of mythological elements, such as Charon and Minos from Dante's "Inferno," highlights the blend of Christian iconography with classical references, symbolizing judgment and moral consequences.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo's use of dramatic gestures, vibrant color, and dynamic composition brings a heightened sense of movement and emotional intensity to the fresco. His mastery in anatomy is evident in the realistic rendering of muscular figures, showcasing the human body's beauty and potential. The layering of figures, coupled with thoughtful use of light and shadow, creates a sense of depth and three-dimensionality, further enhancing the drama of the scene.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>While The Last Judgement is a masterpiece of art, it also reflects the social hierarchies and religious beliefs of the time. The depiction of saints, clergy, and mythical figures in positions of power contrasts with the damned, often portrayed in agonizing and dehumanized forms. This stark binary aligns with the hierarchical ideologies of the church, underscoring the disparities in spiritual and social status.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>In the fresco, Michelangelo portrays physical deformities and tormented expressions that some scholars interpret as reflections of diseases common during the Renaissance, such as plague, leprosy, and syphilis. These depictions align with medieval and Renaissance beliefs linking physical afflictions to sin and moral corruption. As such, the figures can be seen both as artistic expressions and insights into contemporary medical understanding.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The twisted poses and anguished faces in the fresco may visually signify ailments. Muscle striations and joint contortions might depict disorders or the effects of malnutrition, lacking medical remedies in the 16th century. Skin discoloration and emaciation appear in damned souls, metaphorically representing spiritual decay but also hinting at the physical reality of diseases prevalent in Michelangelo's time.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment approaches in the Renaissance were rudimentary, involving herbal remedies, bleeding, and spiritual practices like prayer and pilgrimage. Disease was often perceived as divine will or punishment, complicating scientific approaches to treatment. The fresco, while not an explicit medical document, embodies these historical perspectives in its dramatic depictions.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The fresco subtly highlights social determinants of illness by reflecting the conditions prevalent in Renaissance Europe—poverty, limited medical knowledge, and religious influences. Plague outbreaks fostered a climate of fear and superstition, with illness often misunderstood and marginalized. Michelangelo’s work mirrors these societal forces, reinforcing existing disparities and cultural narratives.</p>
