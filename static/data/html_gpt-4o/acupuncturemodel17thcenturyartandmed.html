        <h1>Acupuncture Model - 17th Century Art and Medicine</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            This 17th-century acupuncture model is indicative of East Asian medical artisans, potentially originating from China or Japan. The artisanship involved in creating anatomical models was prominent in regions where acupuncture was a crucial medicinal practice.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            During the 17th century, societies in China and Japan were immersed in the Confucian principles of balance and harmony regarding health practices. The period was characterized by an increasing understanding of human anatomy within these socio-cultural contexts.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>
            This model showcases numerous meridians running along the body's surface, symbolically representing pathways through which qi (life force) flows. These meridians are crucial to traditional acupuncture practices.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>
            The model employs elements of symmetry and proportion, pivotal in providing medical accuracy during demonstrations. The lines mapping the meridians are both aesthetic and informative, integrating art with functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional medicine, especially acupuncture, was often exclusive to certain classes or regions, resulting in disparities in healthcare access. This model likely served the educated and affluent.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            The model does not depict specific diseases but serves as a didactic tool to teach optimal qi flow and the prevention of ailments according to ancient theories.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Absence of qi flow or blocked meridians could signify illness. Observing muscle tension or skin changes along the meridians possibly indicated areas requiring intervention.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Acupuncture treatment would involve inserting needles at specific meridian points to restore balance and health, alleviating symptoms of various ailments noted through these models.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Access to healthcare practices like acupuncture was influenced by social status, economic conditions, and regional practices, affecting disease outcomes and general well-being.
