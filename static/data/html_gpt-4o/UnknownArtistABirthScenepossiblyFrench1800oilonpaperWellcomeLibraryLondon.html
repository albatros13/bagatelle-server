        <h1>A Birth Scene Wellcome Library London</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork titled "A Birth Scene," housed in the Wellcome Library, London, is attributed to an unknown artist, possibly French, from around 1800. The anonymity of the artist often reflects a focus on the narrative or subject matter rather than personal recognition, a common phenomenon in such historical works.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The early 19th century in France was a period of burgeoning medical knowledge, intertwined with traditional practices. It was a time when scientific exploration began to replace mystical explanations for human processes, including childbirth. The dynamics of gender roles also influenced how childbirth was portrayed, with men starting to enter a domain traditionally dominated by women.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting depicts a raw and unembellished scene of childbirth, a natural yet significant human event. The positioning of the figures may symbolize the complex social roles and support systems surrounding birth. The presence of a man hints at a shift in the intimate dynamics of birth attending, where male midwives began to be more accepted, altering the purely female-centric space of childbirth.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The piece cleverly employs the use of chiaroscuro, contrasting light and shadow to highlight the drama of the event. The central figure is illuminated, focusing the viewer's attention on the intense physical and emotional experience of childbirth. The use of oil on paper allows for a softness that contrasts with the sharp intensity of the scene's subject matter.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During this era, access to medical care, including during childbirth, was largely determined by social class. Wealthier individuals were able to afford professional care, while the poor relied on traditional practices and community midwives. This painting may capture such a nuanced interaction between different classes and roles during a birth scene.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The artwork itself doesn't directly depict a specific disease, but rather, it underscores childbirth — a natural process that could lead to various complications without proper care. Common issues included infections, obstructed labor, and hemorrhaging, often resulting in high maternal and infant mortality rates during this period.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Signifiers of potential complications in this scene might include the depicted distress of the mother, indicative of difficult labor. The presence of blood, visible in the painting, can be a natural part of childbirth but also a precursor to hemorrhage, a serious post-birth complication.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments in the early 1800s were relatively primitive by today’s standards. Midwives or male physicians would perform basic delivery techniques. In some cases, surgical interventions were necessary, but the absence of modern anesthesia and sanitary conditions increased risks. Herbal remedies were often employed to ease labor pain and postpartum recovery.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as socioeconomic status, education, and access to healthcare played significant roles in maternal well-being. Those who could not afford medical care faced higher risks due to lack of access to experienced practitioners or clean environments, which were crucial for reducing infection rates.</p>
