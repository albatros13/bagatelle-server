        <h1>Hieronymus Bosch: The Procession of Cripples</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Hieronymus Bosch, a Dutch painter from the late Middle Ages, is renowned for his imaginative and often surreal depictions in art. Known for his religious narratives filled with vivid imagery, Bosch's works often delve into the complexities of the human condition and sin.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>The drawing "The Procession of Cripples" dates to around 1500. During this era, Europe was transitioning from the medieval period into the Renaissance. This time was marked by rapid social changes, including the rise of humanism, which influenced art, science, and culture. Bosch’s work reflected societal concerns, including the fate of humankind, spirituality, and morality.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>This artwork, featuring a multitude of disabled figures, likely symbolizes the widespread suffering and the perceived notion of sin during Bosch's time. The cripples, often seen as allegorical representations of sin, reflect societal views on disability and morality.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Bosch’s style is characterized by intricate details, vivid depictions of folly, and mastery in portraying complex compositions. The sketch-like quality of this drawing emphasizes simplicity yet invites detailed examination. The repetition and rhythm created by the pattern of the figures add to the thematic depth of the artwork.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During Bosch’s era, physical disabilities were often interpreted as manifestations of moral failings or divine punishment. The lack of understanding regarding disabilities fostered social inequities. People with disabilities frequently lived marginalized lives, highlighting the social challenges they faced.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While specific diseases are not explicitly mentioned, the depiction of cripples suggests a variety of physical impairments, possibly resulting from conditions such as polio, leprosy, or other chronic physical disabilities prevalent during the medieval period. The etiology of these conditions was largely misunderstood, often attributed to supernatural causes.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The imagery in Bosch’s drawing displays individuals with visible deformities, exaggerated postures, and the use of aids such as crutches. These serve as visual markers of physical impairment and align with historical depictions of disability as a visible and identifiable trait.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the Middle Ages, medical treatment for disabilities was rudimentary at best. Treatments were largely primitive, relying on religious or superstitious remedies. Herbal medicine and faith-based healing were common, reflecting the limited medical understanding of the time.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Poverty, malnutrition, and poor living conditions were significant social determinants affecting the health of individuals in Bosch’s time. The lack of medical infrastructure and understanding exacerbated the suffering of those with disabilities, perpetuating social inequality.</p>
