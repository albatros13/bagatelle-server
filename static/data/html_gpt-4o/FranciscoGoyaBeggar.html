        <h1>Francisco Goya - Beggar</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Francisco Goya (1746–1828) was a renowned Spanish painter and printmaker, known for his distinct style and profound impact on modern art. Often referred to as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns, Goya’s work spanned illustrations of social and political upheavals, encapsulating the spirit of his time.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Goya's career unfolded during an era marked by significant socio-political changes in Spain — including the tumultuous times of the Napoleonic Wars and the subsequent Spanish War of Independence. His artwork during this period began reflecting not just portraits of nobility, but the distress and tragedies experienced by ordinary individuals.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>In "Beggar," Goya captures vulnerability and human fragility. The image of the beggar symbolizes social neglect and the desperation of those marginalized by society. The use of dark tones and blurred lines might echo the bleak existence and obscured hopes faced by individuals during his era.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork effectively uses chiaroscuro to bring out depth and contrast, enhancing the serious tone of the subject. Goya's distinctive brushwork and etching techniques lend a raw texture to the image, aligning with the theme of grit and hardship depicted in the subject’s expression and posture.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Goya's depiction of a beggar sheds light on the social disparities existing in late 18th and early 19th century Spain. The stark representation of poverty amidst prevailing affluence among the elite class emphasizes the economic inequality and neglect that permeated society.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The beggar appears feeble and possibly afflicted by maladies common among the impoverished during Goya's lifetime. Malnutrition and diseases such as tuberculosis could be inferred, given their prevalence among lower socioeconomic groups of the period.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The depiction of the beggar with a hunched posture, using crutches, and a worn expression could indicate physical ailments like arthritic conditions or systemic diseases exacerbated by poor living conditions, significant malnourishment, or lack of medical care.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the 18th and 19th centuries, medical treatments available to the underprivileged were minimal. Remedies were often herbal, and access to medical care was limited. Public health measures were rudimentary, leaving many illnesses untreated and individuals unsupported.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Key factors contributing to the beggar’s health condition included poverty, lack of medical resources, inadequate nutrition, and harsh living conditions. Social inequity played a significant role in determining one’s health and access to treatment during this period.</p>
