        <h1>Art and Biomedical Analysis of "STD Anguished Man"</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>"STD Anguished Man" is attributed to an unknown artist, recognized within certain circles for capturing poignant emotional and physical expressions related to human suffering. The work lacks a recorded creator, invigorating its mythos and allure.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>While the exact creation date is uncertain, the artwork appeared in public awareness in the late 20th century, reflecting a modern setting around discussions of health crises, particularly sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), which became prominent due to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting symbolizes anguish and despair, identifiable through the open mouth and wide eyes. This might reflect the cultural silence that often accompanies topics like disease and sexual health, illustrating a cry for awareness and empathy.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The use of dark, earthy colors paired with the expressionist style evokes a visceral emotional response. The jagged, unrefined strokes and the exaggerated facial features align with the principles of expressionism to highlight emotional turmoil and physical vulnerability.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This artwork can be understood as responding to the inequities in healthcare access, particularly for marginalized communities disproportionately affected by STDs due to socioeconomic barriers.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The artwork's title hints at a focus on sexually transmitted diseases. STDs are infections that are primarily spread through sexual contact, caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. They often carry social stigma, impacting those affected both physically and emotionally.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The painting's anguished expression could signify the physical pain and psychological distress associated with untreated STDs. Symptoms like sores, rash, or fatigue often accompany these diseases, reflected in the stark, troubled imagery.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment of STDs varies; bacterial infections like chlamydia and gonorrhea are treatable with antibiotics, while viral STDs like HIV require antiretroviral therapy to manage symptoms and prevent progression. The artwork’s starkness may underscore the need for awareness and proper treatment access.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as poverty, education level, and societal stigma play significant roles in the incidence and progression of STDs. The lack of resources and proper health education often leads to misunderstanding and insufficient treatment of these conditions.</p>
