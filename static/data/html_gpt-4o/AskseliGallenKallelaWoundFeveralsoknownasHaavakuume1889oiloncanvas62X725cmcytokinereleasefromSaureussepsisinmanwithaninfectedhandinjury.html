        <h2>Wound Fever (Haavakuume) by Akseli Gallen-Kallela</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Akseli Gallen-Kallela was a Finnish artist known for his contributions to the national romanticism movement. His work often portrayed Finnish myths, legends, and the natural environment, illustrating his deep connection with his cultural roots.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>The painting “Wound Fever” was created in 1889, during a period of intense national awakening in Finland. This era focused on cultural identity, influenced by the Romantic nationalism spreading across Europe. As Finland sought independence from Russian rule, artists like Gallen-Kallela played a significant role in forging a Finnish identity through art.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
        <p>The piece depicts a man suffering from an infection, symbolizing human frailty and the thin boundary between life and death. The use of domestic interiors can also suggest the struggle faced by many due to lack of access to advanced medical care. The image of an injured hand with a bandage signifies vulnerability and the harsh realities of working-class life.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>Gallen-Kallela employed a realist approach, emphasizing detail in texture and form. The artist’s use of light and shadow creates a dramatic atmosphere, enhancing the emotional depth of the subject. The composition directs the viewer's focus to the man's expressive face and injured hand, highlighting the intensity of his suffering.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The painting reflects the socio-economic challenges of the 19th century, where the less privileged bore the brunt of inadequate healthcare systems. Gallen-Kallela’s work implicitly critiques the disparities in living conditions and underscores the need for societal reforms to address these inequities.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The painting may illustrate a case of infection leading to fever, possibly indicative of a staphylococcal infection (S. aureus) in the hand injury shown. Poor sanitary conditions and limited medical knowledge of the time often resulted in such infections becoming severe or even fatal.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The painting captures visual cues of the illness: the man's weary expression, the visible swelling/inflammation of the injured hand, and possible fever-induced perspiration. These details effectively communicate the physical toll of the infection.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>During the late 19th century, treatment for such infections was limited. Basic wound care, including cleansing and bandaging, was common. The lack of antibiotics meant reliance on natural remedies and rest. The man's bedridden state in the painting signifies the immobilization often recommended.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The settings represent common living conditions that contributed to the spread of infection: overcrowded dwellings, insufficient nutritional intake, and poor hygiene. These factors highlight socioeconomic influences on health and emphasize the ripple effects of poverty on disease outcomes.</p>
