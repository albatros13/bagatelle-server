        <h1>Phaedra and Hippolytus Roman Marble</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The marble relief titled "Phaedra and Hippolytus" is attributed to Roman artisans from the Hellenistic period who were inspired by Greek mythological themes. The specific artist remains unknown, as was common with many works of this era, yet their skill reflects the fine tradition of Roman sculpture, which often emulated Greek techniques and narratives.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>Created around 290 CE, this marble relief was a product of the late Roman Empire. The period was marked by significant social and political transformations, including the spread of Christianity and the increasing complexity of Roman society. Artworks from this time often focused on mythological or historical storytelling, serving both educational and decorative purposes in Roman villas.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The relief vividly portrays the tragic myth of Phaedra and Hippolytus. Phaedra's love for her stepson Hippolytus, as depicted, symbolizes unrequited love and the devastating consequences of forbidden desires. The presence of Cupid, the Greek god of love, underscores the theme of love's destructive potential, while the various figures reveal the complex interplay of fate and human passions.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The relief is characterized by its dynamic composition and intricate details. The use of high relief gives depth and emotive power to the scene, allowing figures to appear lifelike and animated. This attention to detail, especially in the drapery and anatomy, reflects the Roman endeavor to capture human emotion and physicality, drawing heavily from Greek traditions.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Roman art was often a reflection of the empire's social hierarchy. The portrayal of mythological themes like that of Phaedra and Hippolytus could reinforce societal norms about familial roles and the dangers of transgressing them. This artwork also serves as a reminder of the limited roles and lack of agency afforded to women, both in myth and reality.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The depiction of Phaedra's unrequited love can metaphorically relate to mental illness, such as depression or hysteria, which were often misunderstood in ancient times. The causes of such "diseases" were frequently attributed to divine retribution or moral failing rather than understood as psychological conditions.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The relief might visually suggest distress through Phaedra's posture, expressions, and the chaotic arrangement of the figures. In classical interpretation, these signs might allude to a troubled mind, hinting at broader issues of psychological turmoil exacerbated by societal constraints.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the historical context, treatments for mental anguish often involved religious rituals, offerings, or appeals to gods, rather than scientific remedies. There was no systematic medical approach akin to modern mental health care, reflecting limited understanding and superstition-based explanations.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The social status of women in ancient Rome, as seen through the character of Phaedra, affected their mental well-being. Restricted freedoms, societal expectations, and powerlessness within family structures could contribute significantly to mental distress, portrayed allegorically in mythological art.</p>
