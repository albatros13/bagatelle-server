        <h1>Foetal Positions in Uterus - Art Analysis</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork titled "Foetal Positions in Uterus" is part of a medieval manuscript created by an unknown artist. These manuscripts were often the collective work of scholars and monks, commonly influenced by Greek and Arabic medical texts.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>This artwork dates back to approximately 1420 during the Late Middle Ages, a period characterized by significant social transformations, including the bubonic plague and the Hundred Years' War. Medical knowledge was evolving with gradual shifts from spiritual to empirical approaches.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The imagery portrays a female figure in varying stages of fetal development. The representations are deeply symbolic, reflecting the limited understanding of human anatomy but also illustrating the sacred nature of childbirth, fertility, and human creation in the medieval worldview.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The artwork employs a linear style with an emphasis on didactic representation. The use of color highlights anatomical features, while the text surrounding the figure reflects an integration of image and scholarly discourse, typical of medical manuscripts of the time.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During the 15th century, women’s bodies were often subjects of curiosity and control within male-dominated medical discourse. This artwork reflects broader social inequities regarding gender and access to medical knowledge which was confined largely to educated male elites.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>This illustration is primarily focused on pregnancy rather than disease. However, it indirectly addresses conditions potentially affecting pregnant women during childbirth, such as obstructed labor, which medieval medicine often misattributed to supernatural causes or humoral imbalances.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>While the artwork is more instructional in nature, it conveys the complexity of pregnancy and the potential for complications. The careful depiction of the fetus in the womb aims to educate and perhaps prevent perinatal health issues by providing anatomical insights.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments in the medieval period for childbirth complications were rudimentary, often involving herbal remedies, spiritual rituals, or rudimentary surgical interventions. This representation was part of an educational effort to improve outcomes through better anatomical understanding.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Key social determinants included limited access to trained medical practitioners, particularly for women and rural populations. Additionally, health outcomes were influenced by social class, diet, and environmental conditions which affected overall health and prenatal care.</p>
