        <h1>Leonardo da Vinci Self Portrait: An Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        Leonardo da Vinci, one of the most renowned figures of the Renaissance, was a polymath whose interests spanned from art to science. Born in 1452 in Vinci, Italy, Leonardo is celebrated not only for his mastery in art but also for his contributions to science and anatomy. His self-portrait, believed to have been created in the early 16th century, showcases his capacity for realistic depiction.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        The portrait is thought to have been drawn around 1512, during the High Renaissance—a period characterized by significant artistic achievement in Italy. This era was marked by a revived interest in classical antiquity and humanism, reflected in Leonardo's intricate understanding of human anatomy and expressions. Economically, Italy was thriving, facilitating the patronage necessary for artistic endeavors.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        Leonardo's self-portrait is symbolic of the Renaissance ideal: the artist as both a craftsman and an intellectual. The portrait serves as both a study in aging and a representation of wisdom and introspection, with the long beard symbolizing sagacity. The somber expression may reflect da Vinci's deep engagement with existential and philosophical inquiries typical of Renaissance thinking.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        The portrait employs sfumato, a da Vinci hallmark, enhancing the depth and realistic quality of the depiction. Lines are soft, blending into the background, allowing for a seamless transition between light and shadow. His use of chiaroscuro demonstrates an advanced understanding of light, contributing to the three-dimensionality and realism of his facial features.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        In Leonardo's time, access to education and the arts was primarily reserved for the elite. Despite his illegitimate birth, Leonardo benefitted from patronage, unlike many others who lacked such opportunities. This aspect emphasizes the period's social inequities, where talent often relied on social class and connections for recognition and advancement.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        One of Leonardo's later pursuits was the anatomical study of age-related conditions. The portrait, depicting an older Leonardo, may hint at conditions like arteriosclerosis, reflected in the aged, lined face. Age-associated systemic diseases, not well understood at the time, were often observed but lacked comprehensive scientific explanation.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        The deep-set eyes and furrowed brow seen in the portrait could imply visual or cognitive decline, or simply the natural aging process. While artistic interpretation must be cautious, some suggest these features signify vitality loss related to cardiovascular health, common in elderly populations of Leonardo's era.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        Treatments for age-related diseases in Renaissance Italy were limited, often relying on balancing bodily humors as per Galenic traditions. Herbal remedies, bloodletting, and diet modifications were common prescriptions, though their effectiveness was variable and scientifically unsubstantiated by current standards.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Leonardo’s work reflects the limited healthcare access and medical knowledge of his time. Social class impacted healthcare access, with wealthy patrons able to afford cures often inaccessible to the average individual. This disparity influenced public health and longevity significantly.
