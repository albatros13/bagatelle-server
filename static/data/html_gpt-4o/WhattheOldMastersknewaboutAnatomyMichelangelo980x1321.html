        <h1>What the Old Masters Knew about Anatomy: Michelangelo</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti, a master of Renaissance art, is renowned for his profound understanding of the human form. His works exemplify a blend of artistic genius and anatomical precision, marking a significant contribution to both art and science.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo's active years as an artist spanned the late 15th and early 16th centuries, a period characterized by a cultural revival known as the Renaissance. This era emphasized a return to classical learning and exploration, particularly in the arts and sciences. The Renaissance period was a time of significant socio-cultural change across Europe, impacting art, religion, and scientific inquiry.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo’s anatomical studies were not merely technical exercises but were imbued with symbolism and profound meaning. Often, his depictions of human figures aimed to convey ideal beauty and divine proportion, reflecting Renaissance humanist ideals which celebrated the potential and dignity of humans.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The stylistic significance of Michelangelo’s works is evident in his sophisticated use of line, form, and shading to suggest volume and musculature. His drawings often display dynamic poses and detailed anatomical accuracy achieved through careful study of the human body, setting a new standard for realism and depth.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>While Renaissance art celebrated humanism, it also reflected the societal inequities of the time. The patronage system often limited artistic work to the elite, and many artists, including Michelangelo, were commissioned to glorify powerful families or religious institutions, perpetuating existing social hierarchies.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>In Michelangelo’s time, understanding of diseases was limited, and illnesses were often attributed to imbalances in humors or divine punishment. Common afflictions recorded in anatomical studies included conditions like scoliosis, arthritis, and various infectious diseases, although precise etiology was not well understood.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo’s drawings occasionally reveal details such as muscular hypertrophy or skeletal deformities, hinting at diseases common during the Renaissance. These anatomical anomalies were sometimes included in studies to enhance realistic representation or to practice depicting various body forms.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments in Michelangelo’s era largely relied on herbal remedies and rudimentary surgical techniques. Bloodletting and balancing of humors were predominant practices, guided by Galenic medicine. The correlation between anatomy and medical treatment was just beginning to emerge, influenced by studies like those of Michelangelo.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The Renaissance period was marked by widespread inequality affecting health outcomes. Poor living conditions, limited access to clean water and nutritious food, and inadequate medical knowledge were common. Michelangelo’s era saw significant disparities in health determined by social status and location.</p>
