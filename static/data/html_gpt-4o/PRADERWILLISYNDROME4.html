        <h1>Analysis of the Prader Willi Syndrome Artwork</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The creator of this sculpture remains unknown, yet its profound impact is evident. The artist employs a realistic style to emphasize the condition represented, aiming to provide a voice to those affected by Prader Willi Syndrome.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS) has been recognized only recently in medical history, accurately identified in 1956. This artwork reflects modern-day awareness and sensitivity to genetic disorders and disabilities.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The artwork is rich in symbolism, depicting a figure with a prominent physical stature, which is emblematic of symptoms like hypotonia and obesity associated with PWS. This visual representation fosters understanding and empathy towards those with the syndrome.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The sculpture employs exaggerated proportions, emphasizing the physical symptoms typical of Prader Willi Syndrome. The textured surface highlights the intricate nature of human conditions, thus serving as a stark reminder of the complexity and challenges faced by individuals with PWS.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The artwork calls attention to the social and cultural inequities experienced by those with Prader Willi Syndrome. Individuals with PWS often face challenges related to access to medical care, social inclusion, and supportive educational settings.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Prader Willi Syndrome is caused by the loss of function of genes in a particular region of chromosome 15. It manifests in stages, with early childhood characterized by hypotonia and feeding difficulties followed by insatiable appetite in later years leading to obesity.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The primary pathological features include reduced muscle tone (hypotonia), chronic hunger leading to overeating and obesity, and developmental delays. The artwork captures these features through the oversized, weighted form of the sculpture.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment for Prader Willi Syndrome is predominantly symptomatic. Growth hormone therapy can address some physical symptoms, while strict dietary supervision and behavioral therapies can manage compulsive eating behavior.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Economic status, access to healthcare, support systems, and educational opportunities deeply affect the quality of life for those with Prader Willi Syndrome. Addressing these social determinants is crucial for effective management and fostering an inclusive society.</p>
