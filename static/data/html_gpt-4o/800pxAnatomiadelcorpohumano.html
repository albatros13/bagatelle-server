        <h1>Anatomia del corpo humano</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        The artwork "Anatomia del corpo humano" is attributed to a tradition of anatomical illustrations that gained prominence during the Renaissance period. This drawing is believed to be influenced by the works of Andreas Vesalius, a Flemish anatomist whose landmark book "De humani corporis fabrica" set new standards for anatomical understanding and illustration.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        During the Renaissance, particularly in the 16th century, there was a resurgence of interest in the study of human anatomy. This period was characterized by a transition from the medieval to the modern world, with an emphasis on science, empirical observation, and direct study of the human body, which was revolutionary at the time.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        The illustration symbolizes the unveiling and understanding of the mysteries of the human body. It reflects the artist's and anatomist's efforts to explore the inner workings of physiology and convey this knowledge visually. The depiction of the human figure, flayed to reveal muscles and tendons, indicates a move away from merely spiritual or philosophical interpretations of the body toward a scientific one.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        This work exemplifies the detailed linework and precise rendering characteristic of Renaissance anatomical illustrations. The careful attention to proportion and the realistic depiction of muscles are significant elements, highlighting the evolution of anatomical accuracy and artistic style of the period. The use of chiaroscuro—contrasting light and shadow—adds depth and dimension.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        During the Renaissance, access to anatomical knowledge was often restricted to elite classes, with dissections typically performed on the bodies of criminals or the poor. This cultural and educational privilege created inequities in who could access and create such detailed works, reflecting societal hierarchies of the time.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        While the artwork does not directly depict any specific disease, it highlights the musculature and anatomy essential for diagnosing and understanding various conditions. During the period, anatomy was foundational for identifying maladies related to surgical interventions and musculoskeletal injuries.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        The illustration itself focuses on healthy, idealized anatomy rather than pathological conditions. However, such artworks were instrumental in enabling physicians to identify deviations from normal anatomy, thus identifying signs of underlying illnesses.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        In the context of the Renaissance, treatment often involved rudimentary surgeries and herbal remedies. The anatomical knowledge gained from such illustrations was crucial in advancing surgical techniques and understanding bodily functions, paving the way for modern medicine.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Socioeconomic status during the time played a significant role in access to healthcare. The Renaissance marked the beginning of more systematic medical education, but it remained inaccessible for many lower-class individuals, resulting in diminished healthcare outcomes compared to the wealthier classes.
