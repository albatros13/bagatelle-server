        <h1>Art and Science Analysis</h1>
        <h2>A. Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork "Napoleon on his Imperial Throne" is a painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Ingres was a prominent French Neoclassical painter known for his precision in detail and classical composure.</p>

        <h2>B. Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted in 1806, this artwork emerged during the Napoleonic era. The early 19th century was a period of great political change and cultural upheaval in Europe as Napoleon Bonaparte expanded his empire throughout the continent.</p>

        <h2>C. Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting depicts Napoleon on his throne, adorned with imperial regalia. The use of rich colors and meticulous detailing symbolize power and authority. The laurel wreath he wears signifies victory and success, while the scepter and hand of justice represent his control over law and governance.</p>

        <h2>D. Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Ingres employed a high level of precision and an academic approach. The symmetrical composition and formal rigidity emphasize Napoleon’s majesty. The use of chiaroscuro adds depth, highlighting Napoleon as the focal point, while the textures demonstrate Ingres’s mastery in painting fabric and metallic surfaces.</p>

        <h2>E. Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting reflects the power imbalance of the era, revealing the disparity between Napoleon and the common populace. It underscores the grandeur of imperial rule versus the realities faced by those outside the elite circle.</p>

        <h2>F. Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The artwork itself doesn’t depict a specific disease, but in a broader sense, the era was characterized by ailments like tuberculosis and smallpox, which were rampant due to the social and environmental conditions.</p>

        <h2>G. Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In referencing the time period, signs of smallpox included the appearance of pustules on the skin, while tuberculosis was marked by severe coughs and wasting. Artwork from this period rarely depicted such imagery, focusing instead on idealism and authority.</p>

        <h2>H. Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments were rudimentary at the time. Smallpox was treated variably, leading eventually to the development of vaccination by Edward Jenner in 1796. Tuberculosis, or "consumption," had no effective treatment until the 20th century.</p>

        <h2>I. Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social class played a critical role in one’s vulnerability to illness. The wealthy, like those depicted in this painting, often had better access to cleaner living conditions and any available medical care.</p>
