        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis of Laura Ferguson's Illustration</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        Laura Ferguson is a contemporary artist known for her unique exploration of the human body's interior landscape. Her work often juxtaposes the beauty of human anatomy with artistic creativity, transcending traditional medical illustration.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        Created in the 21st century, Ferguson's work emerges during a time when interdisciplinary approaches to art and science are increasingly valued. The visible skeleton series, part of which is the reclining figures illustration, reflects this blending of disciplines.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        Ferguson's illustrations symbolize the fragility and complexity of the human body. By exposing skeletal structures, she invites viewers to ponder the inner workings of themselves, thus serving both as an art piece and a meditative tool.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        The piece is characterized by its intricate use of line and texture. Ferguson employs delicate lines to trace the contours of the skeleton while using rich textures and earth tones to evoke a sense of depth and warmth, inviting viewers to look beyond the surface.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        The work can be seen as commentary on access to medical knowledge and health care. By demystifying anatomy through art, Ferguson opens dialogue regarding who is allowed to understand and benefit from such insights.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        The artwork doesn’t illustrate a specific disease but instead focuses on the normal anatomical structures visible beneath the skin. However, in a broader sense, the depiction can symbolize many hidden ailments and conditions that afflict individuals, often unnoticed until symptoms manifest.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        While not a direct representation of disease, subtle variations in the skeletal forms might suggest abnormalities or conditions such as scoliosis or arthritis, common issues explored in medical anatomy.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        Any medical treatment implied in the artwork would be preventative and educational. By understanding the visual depiction of anatomy, both patients and practitioners can enhance their comprehension of maintaining health.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Ferguson’s work raises awareness of how social determinants such as education, socioeconomic status, and access to health care influence understanding and management of personal health.
