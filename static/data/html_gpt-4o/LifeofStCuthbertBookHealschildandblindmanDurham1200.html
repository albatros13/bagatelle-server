        <h2>Life of St Cuthbert Book Heals Child and Blind Man, Durham (1200)</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>
            The artwork is attributed to the medieval artisans and monks in Durham, England. The creation of illuminated manuscripts was a collaborative effort often involving monastery scribes and illustrators who were devoted to religious works. St Cuthbert’s manuscript reflects the artistic styles prevalent in Northern England's ecclesiastical settings.
        </p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>
            This illumination belongs to the early 13th century, around the year 1200. It was created during a period marked by the flowering of monastic culture and book production. Monasteries were centers for spiritual, intellectual, and artistic life, preserving knowledge and producing texts. The influence of the Church was paramount, affecting all aspects of life and art.
        </p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>
            The imagery in the St Cuthbert manuscript is loaded with religious symbolism. St Cuthbert is depicted performing miracles, emphasizing divine healing and compassion. The use of halos, gestures of blessing, and religious attire reinforces the sanctity and spiritual authority of the figures. The iconography serves to inspire faith among medieval viewers, illustrating the miraculous intercession of saints.
        </p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>
            Stylistically, the manuscript illustrates characteristics of Romanesque art with bold colors, defined outlines, and symmetrical compositions. The lack of perspective and flat backgrounds are typical of this period. The artwork employs gold leaf to signify holiness, and the figures are portrayed with serene expressions, characteristic of religious iconographic traditions.
        </p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>
            During this period, access to such illuminated texts was restricted to wealthy patrons, clergy, and nobility. The broader lay population could not read or afford such manuscripts, demonstrating a significant cultural and educational divide. Educational opportunities were scarce for the lower classes, perpetuating a cycle of inequality.
        </p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>
            The manuscript depicts scenes of miraculous healing. The child's illness is not detailed but suggests pediatric afflictions of the time, possibly fever or infection. The blind man's condition could be due to cataracts, trachoma, or other prevalent eye diseases exacerbated by poor living conditions and insufficient medical understanding.
        </p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>
            The illustration shows signs such as the child's fragile appearance and the blind man’s pleading posture. These visual cues highlight common midieval symptoms like pallor and incapacitation. The artwork doesn’t depict the diseases' specifics but uses these signifiers for the audience to understand the nature of the miracle.
        </p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>
            Medical treatments during this period were rudimentary. Reliance on herbal remedies, bloodletting, and prayer was common. The artwork’s focus on miraculous healing emphasizes the period's spiritual approach to medicine, where faith in divine intervention often substituted for actual medical treatment.
        </p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>
            Medieval society faced numerous health challenges due to poverty, malnutrition, and limited medical knowledge. Living conditions were poor, with inadequate sanitation contributing to widespread disease. Access to medical care was minimal, reinforcing health disparities linked to social and economic status.
