        <h2>Mosaics at Monreale Cathedral (1180): A Historical and Medical Perspective</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The mosaics at Monreale Cathedral were created by Byzantine artisans around the year 1180. These talented craftsmen were part of a larger group of artists who were commissioned to work on sacred spaces throughout Sicily during this period. The Byzantine influence is evident in their style and execution.</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>The Monreale Cathedral mosaics were crafted during the Norman rule in Sicily, a time of great cultural synthesis and exchange between the Normans, Byzantines, Arabs, and Latins. This era, marked by a blending of artistic and architectural styles, demonstrates the cross-cultural interactions in the Mediterranean during the 12th century.</p>
        
        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The mosaics depict biblical stories rich in Christian iconography, symbolizing themes of faith, devotion, and divine intervention. Each scene is imbued with symbolic elements such as divine figures, dressed in Byzantine robes, conveying messages of divine guidance and the celestial hierarchy prevalent in Christian ideology of the time.</p>
        
        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>The artwork is characterized by its vivid use of color, intricate detailing, and a balanced composition. The use of gold tesserae, a hallmark of Byzantine artistry, reflects the divine light and highlights the figures' holy nature. The linear forms and frontal composition imbue the figures with a solemn and timeless presence.</p>
        
        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Though a harmonious expression of multiple cultural influences, the mosaics also reflect the social hierarchies and inequities of the time. Commissioned by the ruling elite, these artworks were a means to express power and religious dominance, often inaccessible to the general populace other than through a religious context.</p>
        
        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The mosaic’s depiction does not explicitly cover biomedical topics, yet if considering the historical period, common diseases included leprosy and tuberculosis. These were attributed to lack of hygiene and crowded living conditions prevalent in medieval societies.</p>
        
        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>In mosaics, biblical stories occasionally illustrated illnesses as divine punishment or spiritual trials. These artistic portrayals included depictions of lesions or pale complexions, representing moral and physical decay.</p>
        
        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment during the medieval times was rudimentary, often consisting of herbal remedies, prayer, and rituals, with an emphasis on spiritual healing over physical cures. Medical knowledge was largely influenced by religious beliefs.</p>
        
        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Much like today, health in the medieval period was greatly influenced by social determinants such as poverty, lack of access to clean water, and inadequate nutrition. Poor living conditions exacerbated the spread of diseases among the lower classes.</p>
