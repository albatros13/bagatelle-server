        <h1>Richard Sargent - Doctor and Dog (1953)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        <p>Richard Sargent was a renowned American illustrator known for his work in magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post. His paintings often depicted humorous and relatable scenes of everyday life, capturing the essence of mid-20th century America.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 1953, "Doctor and Dog" reflects the post-World War II era in the United States. This period was characterized by economic prosperity and optimism, contrasting the previous decades’ hardships. Domestic life became a focal point in popular art, and illustrations like Sargent's mirrored the cultural values and societal norms of the time.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The illustration features a doctor attending to a child under the watchful eye of a large, concerned dog. The doctor symbolizes care and professionalism, while the dog’s presence suggests loyalty and companionship. These elements work together to create a comforting and humorous portrayal of an ordinary medical visit.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Sargent’s work is marked by a warm color palette and meticulous attention to detail. The composition is both balanced and dynamic, drawing the viewer’s attention to the interplay between the characters. The use of space and perspective enhances the realism, making the scene both inviting and engaging.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>While the artwork presents an idealized version of healthcare accessibility, it omits the social and economic disparities prevalent during the era. The 1950s were marked by significant racial and economic inequalities, which affected access to medical care for various demographics, something not addressed in the illustration.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The child's illness is not explicitly identified, but the scene conveys a generic domestic illness common in children, such as a cold or fever. In the context of the 1950s, such illnesses were typically mild and treated at home by family doctors.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The child’s flushed face and discontented expression suggest symptoms like fever or discomfort, common in viral infections. The bottle on the table may indicate medicine or a home remedy typically used in the 1950s.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During this period, treatments for common pediatric illnesses often involved bed rest, hydration, and simple, over-the-counter medications. The doctor’s presence implies a practiced combination of medical knowledge and bedside manner appropriate for the time.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>In 1950s America, access to healthcare was often determined by socio-economic status. Middle-class families, as depicted, generally had more consistent access to quality medical care, whereas marginalized groups faced systemic barriers in receiving similar treatment.</p>
