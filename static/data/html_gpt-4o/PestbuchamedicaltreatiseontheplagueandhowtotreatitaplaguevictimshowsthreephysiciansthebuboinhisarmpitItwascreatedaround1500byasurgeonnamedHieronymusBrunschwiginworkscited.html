        <h1>Pestbucha: An Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        Hieronymus Brunschwig, a renowned surgeon of the early 16th century, is credited with creating the Pestbucha, a medical treatise on the plague. Known for his contributions to medical knowledge and practices of the time, Brunschwig's work offers insights into the perception and treatment of plague during the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        The Pestbucha was created around 1500, a time when Europe was experiencing repeated outbreaks of the bubonic plague. The image reflects a society grappling with disease, highlighting the prevalent fears and uncertainties. This period was marked by a lack of effective medical remedies and a reliance on empirical knowledge passed down through generations.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        The imagery in the Pestbucha is rich with symbolism. The depiction of the bubo in the armpit of the plague victim served as a crucial diagnostic feature. The presence of three physicians signifies the importance of consultation and medical collaboration, while the somber expressions underscore the gravity and pervasive helplessness in treating the plague.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance</h2>
        The artwork employs elements of line and detail, characteristic of woodcut illustrations of that era. The use of linear perspective and hierarchical scale place emphasis on the plight of the infected individual, focusing the viewer’s attention on the interaction between the patient and physicians. The clarity of detail assists in the educational purpose of the treatise.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        During Brunschwig's time, the burden of the plague was disproportionately borne by the lower classes and those with limited access to healthcare. This treatise highlights the disparity in knowledge and resources between the educated elite and the general populace, illustrating socio-economic divides in healthcare access and responses to epidemics.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        The bubonic plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, was transmitted through fleas living on rats and other animals. Symptoms included fever, chills, headache, and the infamous buboes, or swollen lymph nodes, which often appeared in the armpit, groin, or neck.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        The prominent bubo is the central pathological sign depicted. Accompanied by systemic symptoms like fever and malaise, these indicators were crucial for identifying the plague. Physicians relied heavily on visual diagnosis, as modern diagnostic technologies were centuries away.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        Treatments during the period were rudimentary, involving bloodletting, lancing of buboes, and herbal remedies. The scene emphasizes consultation and empirical observation, acknowledging both the limitations and efforts of contemporary medical practices.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Living conditions, hygiene, and urban density significantly influenced the spread of the plague. Poorer communities, often situated in squalid environments, faced higher risks of infection. The Pestbucha illustrates these challenges, shedding light on the intersection of health and socio-economic conditions.
