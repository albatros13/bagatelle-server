        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis of the Chakra Diagram</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artist of this piece is unknown, but it is likely created by a practitioner or student of ancient Indian spirituality or Ayurveda. This style of drawing is typically associated with yogic and Vedic traditions, known for combining artistic expression with spiritual significance.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>This kind of artwork is deeply rooted in the traditions of Indian spirituality, particularly focusing on practices such as Yoga and Ayurveda. These practices date back to ancient times, with their origins in the Indus Valley Civilization (circa 3000 BCE) and later developing through Vedic and post-Vedic periods. The socio-cultural context of this artwork reflects the integration of art, spirituality, and medicine.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The chakras are symbolic representations of energy centers in the body, each associated with different spiritual, emotional, and physical attributes. This drawing illustrates the seven primary chakras aligned along the spine, accompanied by subtle veins known as nadis. The iconography is rich with symbols representing health, balance, and spiritual enlightenment.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>The artwork uses line drawing to emphasize clarity and precision, honoring the traditional depiction of spiritual anatomy. The balance and symmetry in the illustration reflect the balance sought in spiritual practice. Pattern and repetition are evident in the detailed rendering of each chakra, showcasing the artist’s skill in representing intricate spiritual concepts.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Historically, knowledge about chakras and spiritual anatomy was reserved for those with access to spiritual and educational resources, often excluding marginalized groups. This reflects broader social inequities in access to education and spiritual education, which were typically accessible only to certain social classes.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>From a holistic medicine perspective, an imbalance in the chakras is linked to various diseases, both physical and mental. Each chakra is associated with specific organs and emotional states, and blockages or imbalances can manifest as ailments ranging from anxiety to digestive issues.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The artwork doesn't depict pathological signs directly, but each chakra is believed to influence specific physical and psychological functions. For example, a blocked throat chakra might manifest as communication issues, thyroid problems, or laryngitis.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Balancing the chakras is believed to be achievable through yoga, meditation, and specific Ayurvedic treatments. These practices involve harmonizing the body’s energy flow, often using breathwork, mantra chanting, and lifestyle modifications to encourage equilibrium within the body's systems.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The spiritual and physical health represented in this artwork is influenced heavily by lifestyle, stress, and socio-economic factors. Access to resources that promote spiritual and physical well-being, such as yoga education and healthcare, still remains unevenly distributed across different social groups.</p>
