        <h1>Acupuncture Model (17th century)</h1>
        
        <h2>a. Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        The 17th-century acupuncture model, often attributed to anonymous Chinese artisans, reflects the prowess of Ming Dynasty craftsmanship. These models were pivotal in the teaching of acupuncture and meridian theories, solidifying their role in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).

        <h2>b. Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        Developed during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), these models were crafted at a time when TCM was experiencing significant evolution. The 17th century was an era marked by extensive exploration and documentation of medical practices in China, amid a backdrop of socio-political stability conducive to intellectual discourse and development.

        <h2>c. Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        The acupuncture model symbolizes the intricate balance and flow of Qi (energy) in the human body, a core concept in TCM. The detailed lines represent meridians, while points signify acupuncture points. This iconography not only served an educational purpose but also embodied the spiritual and holistic approach of Chinese medicine.

        <h2>d. Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        The model exhibits precision and attention to detail, encapsulating the principles of realism and anatomical accuracy. The anatomical features highlight proportionality and symmetry, elements crucial in both the artistic depiction and medical application. This attention to detail emphasizes the model's dual function as both a scientific tool and an art piece.

        <h2>e. Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        While acupuncture was integrated into mainstream medical practices, access to such specialized knowledge was restricted to scholars and the educated elite, highlighting social hierarchies inherent in Ming society. Women and lower classes had limited access, underlining the inequities in medical education and practice.

        <h2>f. Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        Traditional Chinese Medicine perceives disease as an imbalance in Qi, blood, and bodily fluids within the meridians. The model was utilized to understand conditions such as headaches, digestive issues, and musculoskeletal pain through the lens of Qi flow disruption.

        <h2>g. Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        Blockages or imbalances in Qi and blood flow were considered primary pathologies. These conditions were identified through symptoms such as pain, swelling, and functional impairment, which the model helped future acupuncturists comprehend and address.

        <h2>h. Treatment</h2>
        Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles into specific points to restore the balance of Qi. The model’s illustrative pathways provided practitioners with precise reference points, facilitating the accurate delivery of acupuncture therapy, aimed at restoring health through meridian stimulation.

        <h2>i. Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Factors such as diet, lifestyle, social status, and environmental influences were recognized as determinants that could influence health and disease. The model emphasizes the holistic perspective of TCM, acknowledging the interconnection between an individual and their environment.
