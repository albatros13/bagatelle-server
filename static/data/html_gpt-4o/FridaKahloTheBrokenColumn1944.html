        <h1>Frida Kahlo - The Broken Column (1944)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist</h2>
        <p>Frida Kahlo was a renowned Mexican artist known for her intensely personal and emotive works often reflecting her own pain and suffering. Born in 1907, she became a central figure in Mexican culture and art, intertwining traditional Mexican motifs with surrealist styles.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 1944, "The Broken Column" is a reflection of Kahlo's physical and emotional struggles during a tumultuous period in history. Post-revolutionary Mexico was undergoing social reform and cultural resurgence, with artists like Kahlo playing substantial roles in political discourse and national identity.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The work is heavy with symbolism; the fractured column represents Kahlo's spinal injuries, and the nails scattered across her body signify her constant pain. The white supporting straps reflect her reliance on medical braces. The barren landscape may symbolize a sense of isolation and desolation.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>"The Broken Column" combines elements of realism and surrealism, with meticulous attention to detail juxtaposed against dreamlike, distorted imagery. The stark contrasts in color and form convey the intensity of Kahlo’s experiences, emphasizing stability in the anatomy versus chaos in the emotion portrayed.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Kahlo’s work sheds light on the socio-cultural inequities she faced as a woman and an artist with disabilities. Her bold portrayal of personal and societal pain challenges cultural norms and advocates for the marginalized.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Kahlo suffered from lifelong pain due to a bus accident at the age of 18, which resulted in multiple fractures to her spine and other injuries. This painting captures the chronic nature of her medical conditions.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The painting vividly depicts the medical braces and the broken spinal column within her, symbolizing the physical manifestations of her injuries. The scattered nails represent the nerve pain she endured daily.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Kahlo underwent numerous surgeries and used various contraptions and medications to manage her pain. The white straps in the painting signify medical braces used to support her fractured body.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Despite her personal adversities, Kahlo’s social standing and recognition provided her access to medical care—though limited by the era’s technological constraints. Her paintings advocate against the neglect faced by individuals enduring chronic pain.</p>
