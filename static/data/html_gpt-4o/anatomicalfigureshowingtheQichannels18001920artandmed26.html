        <h1>Qi Channels: Art and Medicine</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        The artwork in question, depicting the Qi channels, is likely to have been created by an anonymous artist well-versed in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practices. During the time frame of 1800 to 1920, many artisans focused on creating educational models for medical students and practitioners. These models often stemmed from a deep understanding of classic TCM texts.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        This piece, dating from 1800 to 1920, reflects a significant era in Chinese medicinal history when TCM was being consolidated and regional practices were being unified. During this time, the Qing Dynasty was in power until 1912, followed by the establishment of the Republic of China. Despite political changes, TCM continued to thrive, supported by a rich confluence of cultural practices and philosophical ideologies rooted in Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        The artwork symbolizes the Qi channels or meridians, believed to be the pathways through which life energy flows. The iconography illustrates the body's interconnectedness, emphasizing balance and harmony - central tenets of TCM. Each line and symbol represents specific meridians and their role in maintaining health, promoting the idea that blockages can lead to illness.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        The simplistic yet precise design of the model emphasizes clarity and educational purpose. The linear representation aligns with the principles of design such as balance, rhythm, and proportion, facilitating comprehension of complex medical ideas. The choice of material and subtle coloration contribute to its aesthetic yet functional appeal.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        Despite the widespread use of TCM, access to such medical education and treatment was largely restricted to certain social classes. Hierarchical barriers existed, with royal and elite classes having better access compared to peasants, reflecting broader socio-economic inequities of the time.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        In TCM, disease is often attributed to imbalances in the Qi flow within these channels. Blockages or disruptions can result from lifestyle, diet, environmental factors, or emotional disturbances. The artwork serves as a guide to understanding and diagnosing these disruptions.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        Illness in TCM is diagnosed through patterns indicating Qi stagnation, deficiency, or excess. These patterns are observed through physical manifestations such as changes in skin tone, pulse variations, and bodily sensations that deviate from the norm.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        Treatments focus on restoring balance and may include acupuncture, herbal medicine, dietary adjustments, and Qi Gong exercises. The artwork assists practitioners in targeting specific meridians for these interventions, promoting holistic healing.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Factors such as socio-economic status, occupation, and access to resources significantly impact health outcomes. This is evident in TCM, where lifestyle and environment significantly influence Qi health, further reflecting societal inequalities.
