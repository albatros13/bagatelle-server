        <h1>Analysis of Omne Bonum: Art and Biomedical Context</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork "Omne Bonum," a 14th-century encyclopedia, reflects the work of James le Palmer, an English scribe and compiler active during the medieval period. The piece was a comprehensive collection of knowledge at the time, incorporating both visual and textual elements.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The 14th century was marked by significant social and cultural transformations across Europe. The period was characterized by the Black Death, recurring famines, and the Hundred Years' War. In this era, leprosy was a prevalent public health concern, often associated with religious and moral connotations.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h2>
        <p>This illustration depicts a priest, symbolizing religious authority, giving instructions to leprosy-afflicted individuals. The image underscores the church's role in providing spiritual guidance and moral oversight during crises. The priest's gesture might indicate absolution or teaching, resonating with the belief that spiritual intervention was necessary for healing.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork employs medieval stylistic elements, such as flat forms, linear perspectives, and dense iconographic details. Gold leaf background adds a sacred quality, while the use of outlined figures and decorative borders ensures religious and scholarly symbolisms are emphasized, serving as both educational tools and visual narratives.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During the 14th century, those afflicted with leprosy faced profound social stigmatization and isolation. People with leprosy were often forced to live outside of towns, away from the general populace, indicating how disease had dire consequences not just for health but also for social dignity and inclusion.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Leprosy, known as Hansen's disease today, is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. The disease primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract, and eyes. It spreads through respiratory droplets, and its incubation period can range from months to many years.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In this illustration, the individuals’ faces are marked with visible lesions, a classic symptom of leprosy. The depiction of facial disfigurement serves both as a realistic portrayal of the disease’s manifestation and, symbolically, as a visible mark of sin and ostracization during the medieval period.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the 14th century, treatment for leprosy was limited and predominantly focused on isolation to prevent spread. Remedies were largely palliative, involving ointments and prayers, reflecting the intertwined nature of medical treatment and religious practices. Modern treatments now utilize multi-drug therapy (MDT) to cure the disease effectively.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social determinants such as poverty, malnutrition, inadequate healthcare, and poor living conditions exacerbated the prevalence and impact of leprosy in the 14th century. These factors, coupled with social stigma, hindered effective treatment and reintegration into society for those affected.</p>
