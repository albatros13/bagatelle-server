        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis of the Artwork</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork is an anonymous creation attributed to early Chinese practitioners who specialized in the development of medical training tools. These artists, possibly combining skills from the realms of both art and medicine, sought to create a visual representation of the human body that could serve educational purposes.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>This piece originates from the Tang Dynasty in China, approximately from the 7th to 10th century CE. During this era, Chinese medicine was flourishing, and there was an increased interest in documenting medical knowledge. The use of physical models to demonstrate acupuncture points became a valuable teaching tool in medical academies, illustrating a harmonization of art and science.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The drilled holes and inscriptions on the figure symbolize specific acupuncture points and the meridians through which qi flows. This artwork serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the intricate network of energy channels fundamental to traditional Chinese medicine. Each mark on the figure carries meaningful intent, reflecting a holistic approach to health and well-being deeply ingrained in Chinese culture.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>The figure exhibits a simplistic yet detailed approach towards anatomical representation, emphasizing form and function over decorative aesthetics. The uniform texture and monochrome palette underscore its utilitarian purpose. Proportions are meticulously calculated to serve educational, rather than purely artistic, objectives. The balance between realism in form and abstraction in symbolic representation highlights the dual function of educating and inspiring awe.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>While acupuncture and knowledge of these techniques were invaluable, access to such medical knowledge was largely confined to the elite and scholarly class, creating inequities in healthcare accessibility. This artwork reflects the societal structure of its time, where social class and education governed one's access to medical care and knowledge.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The focus of this piece is not on a specific disease but on the practice of acupuncture used for a variety of ailments. Acupuncture was believed to address the imbalance of yin and yang within the body, which was thought to cause illness. Each acupuncture point, identified on the model, corresponds to specific symptoms or conditions that can be alleviated through its stimulation.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>This model doesn't depict outward pathology but rather signifiers of treatment points for conditions such as pain, digestive disorders, respiratory troubles, and mental health issues. The precise location of each point was considered crucial for diagnosing internal imbalances, reflecting sophisticated diagnostic practices.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Acupuncture involved inserting fine needles into the points shown on the model to restore the flow of qi. This practice was supplemented with herbal medicine and moxibustion, indicating a comprehensive treatment framework. These therapies aimed to correct imbalances in energy flow, thus alleviating the underlying causes of illness.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Diet, seasonal changes, and emotional states were considered important determinants of health and illness in traditional Chinese medicine. This model signifies the importance of external and internal factors influencing one's health. Socio-economic status also played a role, affecting access to such treatments and knowledge.</p>
