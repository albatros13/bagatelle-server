        <h1>The Agnew Clinic by Thomas Eakins (1889)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Thomas Eakins was an American realist painter, photographer, and sculptor, widely acknowledged for his dedication to capturing the human body with meticulous anatomical precision. Eakins' contribution to American art is marked by his realistic portrayals of everyday scenes, evident in paintings and sculptures created during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted in 1889, "The Agnew Clinic" reflects the medical and social milieu of the late 19th century. This era witnessed significant advancements in medicine, particularly in surgical techniques and anesthesia. The painting was commissioned to honor Dr. D. Hayes Agnew, a distinguished surgeon, on his retirement from the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting prominently features Dr. Agnew standing apart, demonstrating authority and wisdom. The surgical procedure symbolizes not just medical progress but the academic rigor and teaching aspect of medicine, with the overhead light emphasizing the demo-orientation of the surgery. Eakins includes the attending male doctors among a few female nurses, indicating the gender dynamics of the period.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Eakins employs realism, emphasizing precision and detail, which is integral to the painting's scientific demeanor. The use of light and shadow emphasizes focal points, such as Dr. Agnew and the patient's body. The composition guides the viewer's eye from the central surgical activity to the observing audience, enhancing the educational aspect of the artwork.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The artwork highlights the male-dominated field of medicine at the time, with women relegated to nursing roles. It underscores the hierarchical structure within medical institutions and the broader societal norms that limited women's participation in surgery and other higher academic pursuits.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The patient undergoes a partial mastectomy, a surgical procedure to remove part of the breast tissue, typically due to breast cancer. During this period, the understanding of cancer etiology was limited compared to modern-day, with surgery being one of the few available treatments.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Breast cancer is characterized by malignant growth in breast tissues, visible as lumps or masses. At the time, diagnosis primarily relied on physical examination, often resulting in late-stage detection, requiring radical surgical interventions like mastectomies depicted in this clinic setting.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the late 1800s, treatment for breast cancer was primarily surgical, with little understanding of or access to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The painting illustrates the educational nature of surgical procedures, serving as both treatment and pedagogical demonstration.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The social determinants, including access to healthcare, gender roles, and educational opportunities, heavily influenced who received medical training and treatment. Economic disparities affected access to advanced treatments, reflecting a societal chasm in health equality.</p>
