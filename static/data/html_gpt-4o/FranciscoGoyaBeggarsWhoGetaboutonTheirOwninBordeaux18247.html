        <h2>Francisco Goya: Beggars Who Get about on Their Own in Bordeaux</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        Francisco de Goya y Lucientes, often simply known as Goya, was a prominent Spanish painter born in 1746. His work includes a diverse range of styles and themes, moving from Rococo to Romanticism, and encompassing many subject matters such as portraiture, social critique, and fantastical imagery.

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        Created in 1824-1827, this artwork represents Goya's late period when he lived in Bordeaux, France. This era followed his escape from a politically tumultuous Spain, marked by the Napoleonic Wars and subsequent conservative monarchial rule. Bordeaux, being a cultural hub in France, offered a certain level of artistic freedom that was not available in his homeland.

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        The drawing depicts beggars in makeshift carts, highlighting issues of disability and poverty. It may symbolize resilience and survival, bringing to light the often unseen struggles of marginalized individuals. This piece reflects Goya’s compassionate view toward the dispossessed and his inclination to capture the authenticity of human experience.

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        Goya’s sketch is simplistic yet rich in texture, displaying his mastery in capturing emotion with minimalistic line work. His use of shading and composition draws attention to the subjects, allowing their expressions and conditions to communicate a powerful narrative. The unadorned background ensures that the focus remains on the figures, enhancing the emotional impact.

        <h3>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h3>
        During the early 19th century, societal inequalities were profound, with poverty and disability often leading to social ostracism. Goya’s work reflects these disparities, challenging the viewer to confront the harsh realities and advocate for empathy and change towards the neglected and downtrodden.

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        Although the artwork primarily focuses on the disabled state of the individuals depicted, it does not specify particular diseases. The subjects may suffer from conditions leading to immobility and requiring makeshift wheelchairs, indicative of various physical disabilities prevalent at the time.

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        The depiction of individuals reliant on cart-like aids signifies disabilities affecting mobility. This visual representation can imply chronic conditions, untreatable by the medical knowledge available during Goya's time, or injuries sustained without access to rehabilitation services.

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        During the early 19th century, treatment options for disabilities were extremely limited. Available resources mainly included rudimentary mobility aids. Goya’s portrayal brings attention to the resilience of individuals making do with what scarce means they had.

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        The artwork underscores the role of social determinants such as poverty, lack of healthcare, and societal marginalization in exacerbating health crises. These factors likely compounded the difficulties faced by the figures in Goya’s drawing, perpetuating cycles of neglect and disadvantage.
