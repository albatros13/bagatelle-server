        <h2>Art Historical and Medical Analysis</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>This anatomical illustration is believed to be the work of anonymous artists from the Middle Ages, a time when the transmission of medical knowledge was often interlinked with artistic expression. These illustrations were usually collaborative works between scholars and artists.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>This artwork is dated around the 15th century, a period when anatomical studies began to flourish with the Renaissance's revival of learning. The context of this time was one of exploration and rediscovery of ancient texts, as well as the beginning of the modern understanding of the human body.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The image above employs iconography that was typical of medieval medical illustrations: the human body depicted with wounds and injuries, possibly representing various diseases or conditions. Each symbol within the artwork often had a dual purpose of explaining a medical condition and serving as a memento mori — a reminder of human mortality.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/principles of design)</h3>
        <p>The stylistic elements include delicate linework and a clear use of color to highlight different body parts and conditions. The principles of design here focus on proportion and symmetry, providing a balanced and informative visual narrative of the human body's anatomy and pathology.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>In the Middle Ages, access to medical knowledge was predominantly limited to the educated elite. This restricted dissemination allowed social and cultural inequities to persist, as only those with access to such knowledge could benefit from advancements in medical understanding.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The anatomical illustration likely depicts a variety of diseases that were common in medieval times, such as plague, leprosy, or syphilis. The etiology of these diseases was often misunderstood, with explanations ranging from imbalances in bodily humors to divine retribution.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Visible signifiers of illness in the illustration include lesions, boils, and discolored skin, all of which were symptomatic of several medieval diseases. Such signifiers helped to communicate the physical manifestations of illnesses to practitioners.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatments in the Middle Ages were rudimentary and often based on a mixture of superstition and early scientific attempts. Bloodletting, herbal remedies, and prayer were common practices, with the hope of balancing the body's humors.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Factors such as poverty, inadequate sanitation, and lack of education significantly contributed to the spread of diseases during this time. Poor living conditions and dense populations in urban centers exacerbated these issues.</p>
