        <h1>Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec: Dr. Pean Operating</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            The artwork “Dr. Pean Operating” was created by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, a prominent French painter, printmaker, and illustrator known for his impactful contributions to the post-impressionist movement. Toulouse-Lautrec is celebrated for his depictions of Parisian life, capturing the vibrancy of its nightlife as well as everyday scenes with a distinctive flair.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            Painted in 1891, this artwork is situated in a time when Paris was burgeoning into the pinnacle of cultural innovation and societal shifts. The Belle Époque era marked a period of peace, prosperity, and flourishing arts, albeit not without its socio-economic disparities. Within this milieu, Toulouse-Lautrec was drawn to both high society and the gritty reality of urban life.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>
            This painting portrays Dr. Jules Emile Péan, a renowned French surgeon, at work. It symbolizes the intersection of art and science during a period when both fields were advancing rapidly. The surgical scene serves as an iconography of progress and the clinical aspects of medical practice in the late 19th century, highlighting the societal reverence for medical professionals.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            Toulouse-Lautrec employs a distinct post-impressionist style characterized by bold outlines and subdued colors. The composition captures the intensity and focus of the surgical procedure, with expressive lines and textures that convey the meticulous nature of the operation. The limited color palette and dynamic brushwork direct the viewer’s attention to the surgeon's skillful precision.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            While society admired the progress in medical science, it didn’t equally benefit all societal classes. The painting subtly alludes to disparities in healthcare access during that era, reflecting broader social inequities where medical advancements were largely accessible only to those of higher socio-economic status.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            Though the precise nature of the surgery depicted isn't explicitly stated, it could involve conditions such as infections or traumas manageable through surgical interventions typical of the 1890s. The artwork indirectly suggests the era’s developing understanding of diseases, focusing on surgical ameliorative practices.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            The emphasis is on surgical pathology, with the patient's condition necessitating operative care. The skilled, concentrated demeanor of Dr. Pean highlights a medical professional’s role in addressing acute bodily disruptions caused by illness or injury.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Surgical treatment, as depicted in the painting, was one of the primary methods to address serious medical conditions during this period. Techniques were evolving, reflecting a transition from rudimentary practices to more sophisticated, albeit sometimes precarious, procedures as medical science advanced.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Access to surgical intervention was often contingent on socio-economic status, indicating a strong correlation between one's place within social strata and availability of healthcare. Factors such as income, education level, and social capital played vital roles in determining health outcomes during the late 19th century.
