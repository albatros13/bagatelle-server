        <h1>Diego Velázquez: Portrait of Sebastián de Morra (1645)</h1>
        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe:</strong><br>
        The renowned Spanish painter Diego Velázquez, who served as a leading artist in the court of King Philip IV, created "Portrait of Sebastián de Morra" in 1645. Velázquez, noted for his extraordinary ability to capture the essence of his subjects, was a central figure in the Baroque period.</p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame):</strong><br>
        This work was produced during the Spanish Golden Age, a period of flourishing arts and culture within Spain. During this era, individuals with dwarfism were often employed as entertainers at royal courts, a social reality reflected in Velázquez’s acute depictions of court life.</p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography:</strong><br>
        The painting is emblematic of dignity and individuality. Velázquez depicted Sebastián de Morra with a serious and thoughtful expression, challenging societal norms which often marginalized individuals with physical abnormalities. The painting shifts focus from the spectacle of difference to the humanity of the individual.</p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design):</strong><br>
        Velázquez’s use of chiaroscuro, the stark contrast between light and shade, enhances the three-dimensionality and presence of De Morra. The simplicity of the background emphasizes the figure, while the rich textures and detailed rendering highlight Velázquez’s mastery in form and realism.</p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities:</strong><br>
        The painting underscores the marginalization experienced by people with dwarfism in 17th century Spain. Despite their often diminished roles in society, Velázquez’s portraits bestowed dignity and individual identity, subverting cultural biases and highlighting the humanity of these individuals.</p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology:</strong><br>
        Sebastián de Morra is believed to have had a form of dwarfism. This condition, which results in short stature, can be caused by genetic mutations affecting bone growth. Dwarfism leads to disproportionate dimensions of the body, often without affecting cognitive function.</p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness:</strong><br>
        The key visual signifier in the painting is De Morra’s stature. His disproportionately short limbs relative to his torso signify a common type of dwarfism known as achondroplasia. The artistic depiction does not focus on these differences as deficiencies but rather as aspects of individuality.</p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment:</strong><br>
        During Velázquez’s time, there were no treatments available to alter or mitigate the physical manifestations of dwarfism. Today, the focus remains largely on addressing associated medical issues and promoting equality and accessibility for individuals with dwarfism.</p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness:</strong><br>
        During the 17th century, individuals with dwarfism faced significant social barriers, often reduced to novelty roles within royal courts. These sociocultural determinants shaped their lives, limiting their opportunities and often relegating them to lives of entertainment rather than equal citizenship.</p>
