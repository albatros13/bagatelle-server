        <h2>Frida Kahlo - Broken Column</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork "The Broken Column" was created by the renowned Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. Kahlo, known for her vivid self-portraits, was part of the post-revolutionary Mexicana movement, contributing to both Mexican culture and international art history.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>Painted in 1944, "The Broken Column" emerges from a time when Kahlo was grappling with physical pain following spinal injuries from a bus accident. This period, marked by immense political and social change in Mexico, saw Kahlo channel her personal trauma into her art, maintaining a dialogue between her individual experiences and broader social narratives.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
        <p>The image of a broken column replacing Kahlo’s spine symbolizes her physical fragility and emotional pain. The nails embedded in her body signify her relentless suffering, while the open landscape represents her feelings of loneliness and isolation. The split torso is a visceral depiction of her vulnerability.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>Kahlo's use of vivid colors emphasizes emotional intensity. The contrast between her fragmented body and the seemingly calm background creates a powerful visual tension. The painting employs surrealistic elements, common in Kahlo’s work, to transcend her personal experience, inviting viewers into her psyche.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Kahlo's art often reflects the struggles against gender and societal norms. In "The Broken Column," the artwork highlights the intersection of personal suffering and broader societal pressures on women, particularly regarding physical appearance and health issues, challenging the idealization of female resilience.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Frida Kahlo suffered from multiple medical issues, largely stemming from polio and severe injuries from a bus accident. The painting symbolically expresses her spinal problems, which led to frequent surgeries and persistent pain.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The nails in the painting are a direct reference to kahlo's enduring pain, while the collapsing column illustrates her spinal instability. These elements vividly depict the chronic nature of her medical conditions.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Kahlo underwent numerous medical treatments, including surgeries and extensive bed rest. Her corset, depicted in the painting, was a medical aid meant to alleviate spinal pain but also symbolizes the constriction of her life due to illness.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Kahlo’s socio-economic background and gender played significant roles in her access to healthcare and societal expectations. The political and social climate of post-revolutionary Mexico also intersected with her personal health narrative.</p>
