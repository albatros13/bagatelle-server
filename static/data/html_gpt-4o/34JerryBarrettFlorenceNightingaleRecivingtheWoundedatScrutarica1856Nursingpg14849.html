        <h1>Art and Science Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork titled "Florence Nightingale Receiving the Wounded at Scutari" was painted by Jerry Barrett in 1856. Barrett was a British painter known for his portraits and historical scenes, often choosing subjects that depicted significant moments of humanitarian and medical achievement.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This painting was created during the Victorian era, a time of significant societal, industrial, and social transformations. The work specifically captures scenes from the Crimean War, which took place from 1853 to 1856. Florence Nightingale, often referred to as "The Lady with the Lamp," is depicted attending to the wounded, highlighting the emergence of modern nursing during a period when hospital conditions were notoriously dire.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>Barrett’s painting embodies strong symbolism through Nightingale's depiction. Her figure stands as an icon of compassion and medical advancement. The presence of the wounded soldiers and medical staff around Nightingale signifies the significant shift towards a more organized and systematic approach to wartime healthcare.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Barrett employs realism to narrate the story, capturing details meticulously. The composition leads the viewer’s eye to Nightingale at the center, emphasizing her role. The use of chiaroscuro—the contrast between light and dark—highlights the somber yet hopeful nature of the hospital setting.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During this time, significant class and gender inequalities were prevalent. Nightingale’s work was groundbreaking, challenging gender norms by leading in a field dominated by men. The depiction of Nightingale in a position of authority also mirrors the changing roles of women in society, yet the war exposed many social class disparities, especially in access to medical care.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The Crimean War saw rampant diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhus, exacerbated by poor sanitary conditions. The overcrowded and unsanitary hospitals were breeding grounds for such infections, elevating the mortality rate among soldiers.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the painting, the physical appearance of the soldiers—such as bandaged limbs, pallor, and visible fatigue—indicates signs of injury and disease. These visuals underline the deplorable health conditions faced by the troops and the urgency for medical reform.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Under Nightingale’s leadership, the introduction of basic hygiene practices transformed patient care. Emphasizing cleanliness, proper ventilation, and nutritious food significantly reduced infection rates. Nightingale’s work laid foundational practices for modern nursing and patient care standards.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Poor living conditions, lack of adequate nutrition, and inaccessible medical care were significant social determinants affecting soldiers' health. Nightingale’s intervention highlighted the interconnection between environmental factors and health, advocating for systemic improvements.</p>
