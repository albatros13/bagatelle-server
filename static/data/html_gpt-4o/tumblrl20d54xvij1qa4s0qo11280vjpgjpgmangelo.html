        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            The artwork is attributed to Michelangelo Buonarroti, one of the most renowned artists of the Italian Renaissance. Revered for his mastery in painting and sculpture, Michelangelo's work is characterized by its drama, detail, and emotional intensity.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            Michelangelo was active during the High Renaissance, a period marked by a renewed interest in Classical antiquity and humanism that spanned roughly from the late 15th to the early 17th century. This era followed the Middle Ages in Europe and was characterized by significant advancements in art, science, and philosophy. The period in which Michelangelo created his art was imbued with shifts in religious and scientific thinking, reflecting broader transformations in society.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>
            Michelangelo’s art often abounds with complex iconography drawn from both Christian themes and classical mythology. In the depicted artwork, the dramatic spectacle and intense emotion underscore themes of human struggle and divine judgment. Snakes and distorted figures may symbolize sin, temptation, and the eternal conflict of morality.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>
            Michelangelo’s works are distinguished by their dynamic compositions and the powerful rendering of forms. This piece is marked by a keen attention to the anatomy of the human body, with intricate muscles and expressions that suggest a profound understanding of human physicality. Use of chiaroscuro highlights the figures, adding to the dramatic intensity and emotional impact.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            During Michelangelo's time, Europe was undergoing significant social and religious changes, including the Reformation. The art of the period often grapples with themes of power, morality, and human frailty, frequently reflecting the struggles between different social classes and religious groups.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            In examining the biomedical aspect, the artwork may offer visual allegories to diseases that were prevalent in Renaissance Europe, such as plague or syphilis. The twisted bodies and anguished expressions could symbolize the physical and emotional torment associated with such illnesses.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            The artwork could be interpreted to show signs of disease such as skin lesions or bodily deformities, which were common physical manifestations in patients suffering from infectious diseases of the time. Each anatomical detail serves as a poignant reminder of the human body’s vulnerability to disease and decay.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            During Michelangelo’s era, medical understanding was limited, and treatments were rudimentary, often involving herbal remedies, bloodletting, and superstitious practices. The artwork’s raw depiction of human suffering could represent society’s ongoing battle with both understanding and curing disease.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Social factors such as poverty, inadequate sanitation, and lack of medical knowledge contributed significantly to the spread of disease during the Renaissance. The depicted anguish may reflect the impact of these determinants on health, mirroring the challenges faced by individuals at the time.
