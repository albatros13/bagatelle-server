        <h1>Chinese Acupuncture Charts (18th Century)</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This piece is attributed to an unknown Chinese artist from the 18th century. During this time, the tradition of acupuncture was deeply embedded in Chinese medical practice, often depicted in manuals and educational scrolls. The artist likely belonged to a guild specializing in medical illustrations, crucial for passing down knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The 18th century in China was a period of relative stability under the Qing dynasty. Traditional Chinese medicine was respected and integrated into daily life. Acupuncture, in particular, was considered a key component of healthcare, used to balance bodily energies and improve health. This chart was part of a broader move to document and formalize medical knowledge.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h2>
        <p>Acupuncture charts are symbolic of the interconnectedness of body and nature. The lines represent meridians, pathways in the body through which life-energy known as “Qi” flows. Points along these lines are pressure points used in acupuncture to treat various ailments. The calligraphy and diagrams emphasize the harmony between text and illustration in conveying complex concepts.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork integrates realism with abstraction. The human figure is depicted with realistic proportions and features, yet overlaid with abstract lines and characters that map out the meridians. The use of color is restrained, with soft hues emphasizing the body’s natural form without overpowering the illustrative details. The design balances clarity and complexity, serving both educational and artistic purposes.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The dissemination of acupuncture knowledge highlights cultural priorities of the time, focusing on holistic medicine access for the elite. However, such medical charts were often inaccessible to the poorer populations, reflecting broader societal inequities. Low literacy rates also meant oral traditions carried much of this knowledge among common folk.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Central to acupuncture is the concept of Qi and its role in maintaining health. Illness is seen as a disruption of Qi’s balance. These charts map out points used to treat various diseases by restoring balance, from digestive issues to respiratory conditions. Acupuncture aims to unlock blocked energy, emphasizing prevention and caretaker roles over direct disease etiology associations modern medicine explores.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The meridian lines and dots on the chart are tools for diagnosis and treatment. Practitioners would read physical symptoms and relate them to disruptions in specific meridians. Signs such as pain or discomfort were interpreted through this lens, guiding where needles should be applied to restore balance and health.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Acupuncture treatment involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the body's surface as depicted on the chart. Each point is believed to correspond to an organ or physiological function, and stimulating these can help improve its function. The practice is often combined with other treatments like herbal medicine, massage, and lifestyle changes to promote holistic health.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the context of Chinese medicine, illness is not only a physical imbalance but is also influenced by lifestyle, diet, environment, and emotional health. The 18th-century Chinese approach incorporated these aspects into treatment plans, preemptively covering areas such as diet regulations and lifestyle adjustments which allowed them to maintain health harmony and address social determinants of illness.</p>
