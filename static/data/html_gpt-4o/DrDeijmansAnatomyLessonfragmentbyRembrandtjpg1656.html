        <h1>Dr Deijmans Anatomy Lesson by Rembrandt (1656)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn, a master from the Dutch Golden Age, is the artist behind this powerful work, illustrating his prowess in capturing the depths of human experience and anatomy.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>The painting was created in 1656, a period marked by scientific discovery and the flourishing of arts in the Dutch Republic. This era was pivotal in the intersection of art and burgeoning medical sciences.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The work employs vivid realism to depict a medical dissection, symbolizing the Enlightenment's quest for knowledge. Tools and expressions serve as icons of human curiosity and the often stark realities of medical advancement.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Rembrandt's use of chiaroscuro highlights anatomical precision, while strong compositional lines guide the viewer’s eye to the central figure, emphasizing a scientific yet humane exploration of the human body.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The artwork also reflects the disparities of the 17th century, where only privileged groups had access to such anatomical explorations, underscoring the social stratification in education and healthcare.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The dissection does not focus on a specific disease but rather serves as a pedagogical tool illustrating normal and abnormal anatomy. Diseases like plague were common, leading to renewed interest in understanding human physiology.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the piece, the cadaver might exhibit signs of surgical intervention or post-mortem changes, showcasing Rembrandt's interest in the physical and scientific details of the human form.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The period's treatments were rudimentary, based on a mix of emerging scientific methods and traditional practices. Dissections like this were essential in advancing medical knowledge which informed more effective treatments.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Poverty, lack of access to clean water, and dense urban living conditions contributed to the spread of illness. The wealthy, however, had better access to healthcare and medical knowledge.</p>
