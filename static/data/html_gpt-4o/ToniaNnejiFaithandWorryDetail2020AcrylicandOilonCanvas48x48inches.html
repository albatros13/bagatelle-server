        <h1>Tonia Nneji: Faith and Worry</h1>
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Tonia Nneji is a contemporary Nigerian artist whose work often explores themes of personal struggle, identity, and resilience. Through her vibrant use of colors and complex compositions, Nneji aims to capture the emotional and physical experiences of her subjects. Her work primarily focuses on representing underrepresented narratives, especially concerning health and womanhood in African society.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 2020, "Faith and Worry" reflects a contemporary socio-cultural milieu characterized by global uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing dialogues about healthcare accessibility in Nigeria and worldwide. It highlights personal and collective introspections and anxieties about health and societal inequalities.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting employs rich symbolism through color and form to convey tension between faith and worry. The deep blues and stark contrasts represent emotional depth and internal conflict. The red fabric introduced in the artwork may symbolize both the vitality of life and the bleeding concern over illness. Such elements contextualize the struggle between hope and fear, a predominant theme in her work.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Nneji's use of bold, flat areas of color and geometric compositions demonstrates a mastery of both form and function. By simplifying shapes and enhancing colors, she creates an introspective environment that compels viewers to focus on the emotive intensity of the subjects. The dynamic interplay of light and shadow functions as a metaphor for dualities present in the theme—faith against worry.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting reflects broader social inequalities regarding healthcare access and the stigmatization of illness, which are significant issues in Nigeria. The pandemic further exacerbated these disparities, highlighting inadequacies in healthcare systems and the societal neglect of mental health, especially in African cultures.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The artwork may implicitly reference conditions such as depression or anxiety, prevalent due to both genetic predispositions and socio-environmental influences. Such conditions are universal, yet they manifest uniquely depending on cultural, economic, and social contexts.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Nneji visually articulates signs of psychological distress, such as tension-filled poses of the figures and the evocative use of contrasting colors. These elements suggest a perpetual battle between hope and despair, mirroring internal psychological states.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Faith, community support, and access to effective mental health care are suggested as means to cope with such anxieties. However, the artwork implies the dual necessity of practical healthcare solutions alongside traditional beliefs.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Socio-economic status, cultural attitudes towards mental illness, and accessibility to healthcare services are critical determinants that influence the prevalence and management of mental health issues in Nigeria, as subtly emphasized in Nneji’s artwork. The interplay of these factors reflects the complex landscape of health inequities needing addressal.</p>
