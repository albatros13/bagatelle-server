        <h2>Woodblock Print from Germany in the Late 15th Century</h2>
        <h3>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>This woodblock print is attributed to the late 15th-century German artist Hans Folz, a noteworthy figure in the history of medieval printmaking. Folz was known for producing both religious and secular works and contributed to the spread of print media in Germany during this time.</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>The artwork originates from the late 15th century, a period marked by the transition from medieval to early modern Europe. This time was characterized by significant social and economic upheavals, including the aftermath of the Black Death, which had ravaged the continent a century earlier. The print reflects the evolving practices in medical treatment of the plague during this era.</p>
        
        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The print shows a medieval medical practitioner lancing a bubo, a common symptom of the bubonic plague. This act symbolizes both the scientific endeavor to understand and alleviate human suffering and the limitations of contemporary medical practices. The tools and attire depicted are emblematic of the period’s approach to medicine.</p>
        
        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>The use of line in this print is characteristic of woodcut artworks, providing clear and bold imagery suitable for mass reproduction. The stark contrast between the figures and the background emphasizes the central action, drawing the viewer’s attention to the medical procedure and the expressions of those involved.</p>
        
        <h3>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>During this period, access to medical care was largely dictated by social status. The elite had better access to emerging medical knowledge and treatments, while the lower classes often relied on traditional remedies. This print is a reminder of the disparities in healthcare that existed and the societal challenges faced by marginalized communities.</p>
        
        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The bubonic plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, was responsible for several devastating pandemics. The bacterium was transmitted through fleas that infested black rats, a common occurrence in the urban areas of medieval Europe. The disease caused swollen lymph nodes, or buboes, which were often lanced by medical practitioners in an attempt to provide relief.</p>
        
        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The print illustrates a practitioner lancing a bubo, a painful and swollen lymph node. Such swellings were typically found in the groin, neck, or armpits of those afflicted. Other symptoms of the plague included fever, chills, and weakness, often leading to a high mortality rate if untreated.</p>
        
        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>The medical practice depicted in the print—lancing—was a common treatment for bubonic plague at the time. It was believed that releasing the pus from buboes would alleviate symptoms. Unfortunately, without antibiotics, such interventions had limited efficacy and sometimes led to further infection.</p>
        
        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The prevalence of the bubonic plague was exacerbated by factors such as poor sanitation, overcrowded living conditions, and lack of medical knowledge. These issues were more pronounced in urban centers, where the disease spread rapidly. Social determinants like poverty and class disparity played significant roles in the impact and response to the plague.</p>
