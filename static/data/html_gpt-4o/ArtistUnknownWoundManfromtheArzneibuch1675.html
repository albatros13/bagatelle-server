        <h1>Wound Man from the Arzneibuch (1675)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The identity of the artist behind the "Wound Man" remains unknown; however, it is attributed to the tradition of medical illustration during the medieval and Renaissance periods. This artwork forms a part of a medical manuscript used for educational purposes by surgeons and doctors to understand human anatomy and injuries.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Originating in 1675, the "Wound Man" illustration reflects the medical practices and societal preoccupations of Europe during this era. This period was characterized by a burgeoning interest in human anatomy, partly stemming from the Renaissance. The illustration served as a practical guide in a time before modern understandings of cleanliness and germs in medical practice had developed.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The "Wound Man" is laden with symbolic meanings and serves as an iconographic tool for educational purposes. The image is a composite of various injuries a person might suffer in battle or accidents, serving to illustrate potential wounds and their treatment. The weapons and wounds depicted symbolize the vulnerabilities of the human body and the perils of the era.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>This artwork employs a straightforward and direct style typical of scientific illustrations of the time. The emphasis is on clear depiction over artistic embellishment. Despite its anatomical inaccuracy by today’s standards, the composition systematically aligns various injuries in a didactic manner, allowing viewers an organized approach to understanding trauma.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The existence of the "Wound Man" highlights cultural inequities of access to knowledge. At the time, such manuscripts were limited to the literate and wealthy, predominantly male medical professionals, reflecting broader societal disparities in education and healthcare access.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Though not focused on a disease, the "Wound Man" imagery deals with trauma and injury—a common occurrence due to warfare and lack of industrial safety. These illustrations educated physicians on potential injuries, indirectly reflecting the etiology of battles and violent encounters.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The illustration serves as a catalog of physical trauma with clear depictions of cuts, punctures, and abrasions. The presence of these injuries—swords through limbs, lacerations, and impaled arrows—act as signifiers of trauma pathology, visually educating on the appearance and location of various injuries.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>While the image itself does not provide treatment methods, it was intended to accompany verbal or written instruction on surgical intervention. The depiction implicitly suggests areas for surgical exploration, suturing techniques, and wound management as understood in the 17th century.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>During the time of its creation, social determinants such as occupation, socio-economic status, and gender vastly influenced one's risk of encountering the illustrated traumas. Soldiers, knights, and lower-class workers were at a higher risk of accident and battlefield injuries, leaving them vulnerable due to limited access to advanced medical care.</p>
