        <h1>Bartholomew by Michelangelo (4)</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe:</strong> Michelangelo Buonarroti, renowned as one of the most illustrious artists of the Italian Renaissance, is the creator of the masterpiece in question. His work in the Sistine Chapel, including the depiction of Saint Bartholomew, remains a pinnacle of artistic accomplishment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame):</strong> Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel were painted between 1508 and 1512 during a period known as the High Renaissance. This era emphasized a revival of classical learning and an explosion of artistic creativity. Commissioned by Pope Julius II, Michelangelo's works were intended to illustrate key theological themes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography:</strong> The image of Saint Bartholomew in Michelangelo's "The Last Judgment" holds deep symbolic significance. Bartholomew is traditionally depicted holding his own flayed skin, referencing his martyrdom and the manner of his death. This iconography reflects themes of sacrifice, resurrection, and the triumph of faith over suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design):</strong> Michelangelo's technique is characterized by dynamic composition and powerful anatomical precision. The muscular form of Bartholomew exhibits classical influence, demonstrating a mastery of human anatomy and movement. The use of chiaroscuro adds depth and intensity, highlighting the dramatic emotion inherent in the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities:</strong> The Renaissance period was characterized by a rigid societal hierarchy, with significant differences in wealth and power. While Michelangelo achieved fame and prosperity, many artists of the era labored with little recognition. Additionally, the Church wielded significant influence over artistic expression, dictating themes and interpretations to align with theological views.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology:</strong> The art depicts a mythical and martyr-like suffering that does not correspond to a biomedical disease, but symbolically represents the pains of St. Bartholomew's martyrdom through skin being removed, akin to the depiction in Christian narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness:</strong> The flayed skin held by Bartholomew is the primary signifier of his violent martyrdom. This depiction resonates with symbolic representation rather than a literal medical condition, visualizing physical trauma and suffering endured in religious narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[h] Treatment:</strong> While not applicable to a real medical condition, the art serves to narrate themes of faith and redemption. Symbolically, spiritual salvation and eternal life, as promised by Christian doctrine, are seen as the ultimate "treatment" for earthly suffering depicted in the artwork.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness:</strong> Michelangelo's depiction indirectly reflects the Renaissance's exploration of human condition—a recognition of moral and societal struggles through artistic expression. During the time, factors such as religious dominance and social hierarchies deeply influenced perceptions of suffering and salvation.
