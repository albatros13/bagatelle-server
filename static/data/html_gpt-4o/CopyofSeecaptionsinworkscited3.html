        <h1>Art and Medicine: An Analysis</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        This image showcases three distinct works by renowned artists: Francisco Goya, Leonardo da Vinci, and Johannes Vermeer. Each artist has left immense impacts on their respective artistic movements. Goya, known for his romanticism, infused his paintings with a profound social critique. Da Vinci, an epitome of the Renaissance polymath, merged art and science like no other, creating timeless masterpieces. Vermeer, a baroque artist, achieved fame through his mastery of light and everyday realism in portraiture.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        The artworks span the late Renaissance to the late Baroque era and early Romantic period, a time where Europe experienced significant social, political, and intellectual transformations. Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" (c. 1503) came during the High Renaissance, marked by humanism and scientific inquiry. "Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Vermeer (1665) reflects the Dutch Golden Age’s prosperity. Goya's "The Wedding" (1791) is set in a time of social upheaval just before the Napoleonic Wars.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        In these paintings, symbolism plays a crucial role. The "Mona Lisa" is famed for her enigmatic smile, a symbol of feminine mystique and human emotion. Vermeer’s "Girl with a Pearl Earring" uses the pearl as a symbol of purity and innocence. Goya’s "The Wedding" captures a crowded scene that symbolizes societal norms and class distinctions pre-French Revolution.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        Each painting presents a distinctive style. The "Mona Lisa" showcases Leonardo’s sfumato technique, creating a lifelike, three-dimensional effect. Vermeer expertly manipulates light to create intimacy and depth, while his detailed brushwork brings out the textures in "Girl with a Pearl Earring." Goya uses stark contrast and dynamic composition in "The Wedding" to elevate dramatic tension and social commentary.

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        The time frames of these works reflect different social strata and inequities. The Renaissance valued human potential yet was confined within rigid societal structures. Similarly, Vermeer’s time was marked by economic prosperity but also gender and class disparities. Goya’s work can be seen as a critique of the societal norms of 18th-century Spain, highlighting disparities in social justice.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        Alopecia, the medical condition noted in these artworks, involves hair loss and is categorized into several types. It can result from genetic predispositions, autoimmune disorders, or environmental factors. These factors were not well understood during the artists' times, yet they depicted subjects with such conditions.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        In art, physical signs of alopecia may have been subtly indicated through attire such as headscarves or by emphasis on facial expressions to express vulnerability and humanity amidst physical challenges.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        Historically, treatment of alopecia was rudimentary, often involving herbal remedies or wigs. A lack of understanding about autoimmune conditions meant such signs might've been hidden or ignored, though now treatment involves medications like corticosteroids or minoxidil.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Social and environmental factors, including stress and nutrition, heavily influenced the prevalence of alopecia in historical contexts. Artworks often reflected these in their depiction of lifestyle and societal conditions.
