        <h1>Alice in Wonderland Syndrome</h1>
        
        <h2>a. Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork associated with "Alice in Wonderland Syndrome" is deeply tied to the illustrations found within Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," originally penned by Carroll under the pseudonym Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. The primary illustrator for the original Alice book was John Tenniel, an acclaimed British artist and cartoonist known for his intricate black-and-white artworks. Tenniel's illustrations have become iconic representations of the whimsical and often disorienting world that Carroll created.</p>

        <h2>b. Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The book "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" was published in 1865 during the Victorian Era, a time of profound social, cultural, and technological changes. The Industrial Revolution had sparked dramatic transformations in urbanization, social class structures, and cultural norms. This era was characterized by strict social mores and a clear division between the burgeoning middle class and the elite. It was also a time rich with exploration in both literature and science, where the mysteries of the mind were only beginning to be unraveled.</p>

        <h2>c. Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The illustrations in "Alice in Wonderland" are rich with symbolism and surreal imagery that blur the lines between reality and fantasy. Tenniel's renderings complement Carroll's narrative through exaggerated characters and scenes that play with scale and perception, such as the iconic shrinking and growing of Alice. These symbolisms align well with the concept of "Alice in Wonderland Syndrome," a neurological disorder that distorts perception of size (micropsia/macropsia) where subjects may feel larger or smaller than they are.</p>

        <h2>d. Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Tenniel's artwork is defined by his use of fine lines and detailed textures, achieved through skilled engraving techniques. The balance and rhythm he creates in his illustrations, along with harmony in composition, provide an element of familiarity within the fantastical narrative. His use of contrast through light and dark shading serves to draw the viewer's attention to particular elements within a complex scene, aiding in the storytelling process.</p>

        <h2>e. Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>While "Alice in Wonderland" is often viewed as a whimsical children's narrative, it subtly critiques the societal and class structures of Victorian England. Carroll's playful yet subversive storytelling highlights the absurdities within rigid social orders and the often nonsensical nature of power dynamics and authority figures, reflected in the erratic behaviors of the characters Alice encounters. These themes mirror the psychological disorientation experienced in Alice in Wonderland Syndrome.</p>

        <h2>f. Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS) is a neurological condition affecting perception. Individuals with AIWS may perceive themselves, their environment, or objects within it as distorted in size. This syndrome is named after the peculiar experiences of size perception described in Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". While the precise causes are not fully understood, AIWS is often associated with migraines, epilepsy, or infectious diseases such as Epstein-Barr virus.</p>

        <h2>g. Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The primary clinical features of AIWS include micropsia, where objects appear smaller than they are, and macropsia, where objects appear larger. Patients may also experience distorted perceptions of time and sound. These perceptual alterations are temporary and episodic, but can be distressing. Neurological assessments and medical history are key in diagnosing the syndrome.</p>

        <h2>h. Treatment</h2>
        <p>Currently, there is no specific treatment for Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Management typically involves addressing the underlying causes such as treating migraines or seizures. When linked to infection, control of the viral illness may alleviate symptoms. Psychological support and reassurance are often vital, as the syndrome can be disorienting and anxiety-inducing for those affected.</p>

        <h2>i. Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The presentation of AIWS may be influenced by social determinants such as access to healthcare, stress due to social circumstances, and the availability of support systems. Those without access to appropriate medical care may experience delays in diagnosis and treatment, potentially leading to exacerbated symptoms or prolonged episodes.</p>
