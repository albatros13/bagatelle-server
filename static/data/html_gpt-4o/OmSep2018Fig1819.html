        <h1>Artistic and Biomedical Analysis: Om Sep2018 Fig1819</h1>
        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</strong></p>
        <p>The artwork in figure 18 was created by Domenico Ghirlandaio, a prominent Italian Renaissance painter known for his detailed portraits and frescoes. Figure 19 was painted by the artist known as Marinus van Reymerswaele, who was active in the 16th century and famous for his depictions of tax collectors.</p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</strong></p>
        <p>Ghirlandaio's "An Old Man and his Grandson," dated 1490, reflects the humanist ideals of the Renaissance, emphasizing realism, anatomy, and emotional expression. In contrast, Reymerswaele's "The Tax Collectors," circa 1567, emerges from the period of the Northern Renaissance, a time marked by detailed observation and vibrant portrayal of everyday life.</p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</strong></p>
        <p>In Ghirlandaio's piece, the grandfather's rhinophyma, or bulbous nose, may symbolize wisdom, experience, or the passage of time. The affectionate interaction between the old man and his grandson reflects the importance of family connections. Reymerswaele’s depiction of tax collectors highlights issues of greed and moral corruption, using the meticulous details of their ailments to critique their character.</p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</strong></p>
        <p>Ghirlandaio's use of chiaroscuro, the contrast between light and shadow, enhances the realism of his subjects. His focus on anatomical accuracy and emotional depth is characteristic of the High Renaissance. Reymerswaele employs intricate detail and vibrant colors to bring texture and vivacity to the fabric and expressions, enhancing the narrative's intensity.</p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</strong></p>
        <p>The representation of rhinophyma in Ghirlandaio’s work subtly addresses social perceptions of beauty and age, while Reymerswaele’s focus on tax collectors critiques social inequalities related to wealth and power. Both pieces provide critical commentary on the societal divisions prevalent in their respective eras.</p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</strong></p>
        <p>Rhinophyma, as seen in Ghirlandaio’s painting, is a condition characterized by an enlarged, bulbous nose due to sebaceous gland hyperplasia, often associated with severe rosacea. In Reymerswaele's work, the icepick scars depicted on the faces of the subjects are indicative of severe acne, caused by inflammation of the sebaceous glands and hair follicles.</p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</strong></p>
        <p>Ghirlandaio’s old man exhibits a ruddy, enlarged nose, signifying rhinophyma's distinct morphology. In Reymerswaele’s piece, the pitted, scarred skin is a hallmark of post-inflammatory acne scars, underscoring the chronic nature of the condition.</p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment</strong></p>
        <p>The management of rhinophyma in the 15th century was largely limited to cosmetic ameliorations, often involving herbal remedies. Today, options include surgical reshaping and laser therapy. Similarly, acne treatments in the 16th century were rudimentary, while modern approaches range from topical retinoids to advanced dermatological procedures to address scarring.</p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</strong></p>
        <p>Both artworks hint at social determinants such as stress and lifestyle, which could exacerbate conditions like rhinophyma and acne. Moreover, access to healthcare and the societal stigma around visible skin conditions might have influenced the representation and perception of these ailments in historical contexts.</p>
