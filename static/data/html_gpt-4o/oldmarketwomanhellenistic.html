    <h1>Old Market Woman: Hellenistic Sculpture</h1>

    <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
    <p>The "Old Market Woman" is an exemplary work of Hellenistic art, attributed to the artists of the late 3rd and early 2nd century BCE. During this period, artists began to explore themes of realism and naturalism, moving away from the idealized forms of Classical Greece. Although the specific artist remains unknown, this sculpture showcases the Hellenistic skill in capturing the human condition and everyday life.</p>
    
    <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
    <p>Created during the Hellenistic period, this sculpture reflects the dynamic cultural environment following the conquests of Alexander the Great. The spread of Greek culture across the Mediterranean and Asia resulted in a melting pot of artistic styles and influences. This era was characterized by an interest in depicting a wide range of social classes and ages, departing from the previous focus on youthful and divine subjects.</p>

    <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
    <p>The "Old Market Woman" symbolizes the everyday life of an aging individual engaged in weary labor. Carrying a basket and appearing physically frail, she embodies themes of endurance and the passage of time. Her expression and posture suggest both struggle and resilience, making her a potent symbol of age and the labor of survival.</p>
    
    <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
    <p>The sculpture is renowned for its realistic portrayal of age and emotion. The detailed carving of the woman’s facial features and the drapery of her clothing emphasizes naturalism. The posture and balance reflect a mastery of proportion and form, highlighting the skill of Hellenistic sculptors in achieving dramatic realism and expressiveness.</p>

    <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
    <p>This artwork suggests social inequities prevalent in the Hellenistic period. The old woman's weary appearance and humble attire represent the lower social strata, highlighting issues of poverty and age-related marginalization. The depiction of such a figure indicates a growing recognition and exploration of societal disparities by artists of the time.</p>
    
    <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
    <p>In the context of biomedical content, the sculpture can symbolically represent the physical toll of aging and possible health conditions such as arthritis. Her hunched posture and expression may correlatively suggest symptoms of chronic pain or mobility issues typical of elderly individuals, likely due to a lifetime of laborious activity.</p>

    <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
    <p>The woman's bent posture, emaciated appearance, and gaunt facial features serve as signifiers of aging-related health issues. These could include osteoporosis, evident in the bent spine, or general deterioration characteristic of the elderly, emphasizing the medical understanding of aging even in historical contexts.</p>

    <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
    <p>At the time of the sculpture's creation, medical treatments for conditions related to aging were rudimentary. Herbal remedies and physical therapies were common, though lacking modern understanding. Societal support was minimal, with care typically falling to family members or community support where available.</p>

    <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
    <p>The woman’s condition and appearance reflect broader social determinants, including economic status and access to healthcare. Her aging and visible frailty indicate a lifetime without adequate medical care or economic means, highlighting the enduring impact of socioeconomic factors on health.</p>
