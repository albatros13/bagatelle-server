        <h1>Extracting the Stone of Madness</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork "Extracting the Stone of Madness" is attributed to Hieronymus Bosch, a renowned painter from the Northern Renaissance. Bosch is known for his surreal and often morally didactic imagery, drawing from religious and folkloric themes. His work frequently captures the folly and eccentricities of human nature.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>Created around 1490, this painting originates from the late Middle Ages, a time marked by superstition and a lack of scientific understanding of mental illness. During this period, many conditions were misunderstood, and treatments often involved spiritual or superstitious rituals intended to expel evil influences. This era was characterized by a powerful church influence over daily life and thought.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting depicts a crude surgical procedure where a "stone of madness" is being extracted from a patient's head. This image symbolizes the medieval perception of mental illness as caused by a physical corruption within the body. The use of a funnel and the presence of various bystanders hint at the folly and ignorance surrounding such practices.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Bosch uses surrealism to convey complex themes of ignorance and human folly. The composition employs a circular layout, guiding the viewer’s eye across the scene with movement and balance. The use of symbolism in objects and the contrast of realistic figures with fantastical elements typifies Bosch’s style. His use of intricate detail and balanced composition highlights the tension between reality and superstition.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting reflects the inequities faced by people with mental illnesses during the Middle Ages. Misunderstandings about mental health led to misdiagnoses and ineffective, often harmful treatments. The painting critiques those who took advantage of the vulnerable, as well as societal complicity in perpetuating superstitions against mental health issues.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>In the context of the painting, the "stone of madness" represents the medieval analogy of mental illness as a tangible affliction. Conditions such as schizophrenia and depression were not understood biologically or psychologically, leading to the belief that physical extraction could cure them.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The procedure depicted, involving the extraction of a so-called stone, indicates a presumed visible and extractable cause of madness, symbolizing the lack of medical knowledge of psychological conditions. The patient’s passive posture suggests submission to the treatment, a common scenario in historical medical practices.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment involved primitive surgical techniques that were unlikely to cure the patient but rather caused additional trauma. Such procedures reflect the absence of effective medical interventions and were often mixtures of folk medicine and rudimentary surgical practices.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social factors, including lack of education and the dominance of religious interpretations over scientific ones, affected perceptions of mental health. Economic status and social position often dictated the availability and type of treatment an individual would receive.</p>
