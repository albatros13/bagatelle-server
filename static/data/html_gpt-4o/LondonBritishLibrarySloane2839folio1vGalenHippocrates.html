        <h1>Art Historical and Medical Analysis of "Galen and Hippocrates"</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork titled "Galen and Hippocrates," found in the British Library's manuscript collection, Sloane 2839, folio 1v, is an anonymous piece, typical of medieval manuscript illuminations. It is attributed to medieval scribes and artists who copied ancient texts, preserving the knowledge of classical figures like Galen and Hippocrates.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created during the Middle Ages, this illustration reflects the renewed interest in classical texts during this period. The artwork is likely from the 12th or 13th century, a time when scholars in Europe were rediscovering Greek and Roman scientific and medical texts, often translating them from Arabic sources.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The image features two pivotal figures in medical history—Galen and Hippocrates. They symbolize the foundation of Western medical tradition. The tools and anatomical diagrams represent the empirical approach to medicine, emphasizing observation and systematic study.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The illustration is characterized by its linear quality and sparse use of color, typical of manuscript illuminations of the period. The simplicity in the depiction serves to communicate complex ideas clearly to the reader, using a straightforward and didactic approach.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The transmission of these works during the medieval period was often limited to monastic communities and the elite, highlighting the disparity in access to knowledge. These inequities extended to medical practices, where only the affluent could afford treatment based on learned medicine.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Galen and Hippocrates wrote extensively about humoral theory, which suggests that health was maintained by a balance of four bodily fluids. Diseases were thought to arise from imbalances, influenced by environmental factors and lifestyle choices, a belief that persisted until the modern era.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Manuscript illustrations often included diagrams of the body and descriptions of symptoms that correspond to the humoral imbalances. The depiction might show signs like discoloration or disproportion in body parts, reflecting medieval understandings of physiology.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments during this time were based on restoring balance within the body's humors. Techniques included dietary regulation, phlebotomy (bloodletting), and herbal remedies, often prescribed based on the writings of Galen and Hippocrates.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as poverty, density of living conditions, and lack of hygiene profoundly affected health in the medieval period. Access to knowledge and education also played a role in determining the quality of healthcare one could receive.</p>
