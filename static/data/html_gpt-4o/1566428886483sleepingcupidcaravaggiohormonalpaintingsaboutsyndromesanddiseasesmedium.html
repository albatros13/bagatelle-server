        <h1>Sleeping Cupid by Caravaggio</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, known simply as Caravaggio, was an Italian painter known for his dramatic use of lighting and intense realism. Born in 1571, he was a pioneering figure in Baroque art.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>"Sleeping Cupid" was painted during a time when the Baroque style dominated European art, around 1608. The period was marked by religious tensions and the Catholic Counter-Reformation, aiming to solidify the church's influence.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The depiction of Cupid, the Roman god of desire, in a slumbering state holds rich symbolic meaning. His sleeping form may indicate the transience of love or innocence before its awakening to sensuality. Cupid's position hints at vulnerability and the fleeting nature of life and desire.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Caravaggio’s use of chiaroscuro, the strong contrast between light and dark, emphasizes the corporeal form of Cupid. The realistic depiction of the body showcased Caravaggio’s commitment to naturalism, breaking away from the idealized figures of earlier Renaissance artists.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During Caravaggio’s time, art was primarily commissioned by religious and wealthy patrons, reflecting their interests. The depiction of mythological subjects was a way to subtly critique social norms within acceptable frameworks. Caravaggio’s art often mirrored themes of marginalization and human vulnerability.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The languid posture of Cupid could symbolically mirror conditions such as sleep disorders or syndromes related to hormonal imbalances. These conditions often result from an interplay of genetics and environmental factors.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the biomedical interpretation, the inert, relaxed posture might suggest signs of muscle atrophy or fatigue often observed in certain endocrine disorders. Cupid’s placid expression might also imply lethargy linked to such syndromes.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The treatment strategies in the historical context were limited to herbal remedies and traditional practices. Modern medicine would approach such symptoms with hormonal therapies and lifestyle modifications, tailored to the specific disorder.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as socioeconomic status, diet, and access to healthcare play crucial roles in the manifestation and management of disease. In Caravaggio's time, these determinants were starkly defined by class and wealth, much as they are today.</p>
