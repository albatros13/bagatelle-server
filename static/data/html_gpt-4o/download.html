        <h1>Art and Medical Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The sculpture in question is believed to be Michelangelo's Pietà, one of the most celebrated works of art from the Renaissance period. Michelangelo Buonarroti was an Italian sculptor and painter renowned for his masterful technique and profound ability to convey emotion through his art.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in the late 15th century, the Pietà was commissioned for the French Cardinal Jean de Bilhères, who served in Rome. The Renaissance was a period marked by a renewed interest in classical antiquity and an emphasis on humanism, which affected the way artists expressed religious themes.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>In the Pietà, Mary holds the lifeless body of Jesus after his crucifixion. This moment of sorrow is captured with profound gentleness and empathy, symbolizing Mary's maternal grief and the human aspect of divine sacrifice. The contrast between the serene expression of Mary and the limp body of Christ underlines themes of compassion and redemption.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo's work showcases a harmonious blend of realism and idealism. The sculpture's balance, proportion, and use of light and shadow bring depth to the marble surface, creating lifelike textures. The drapery’s folds lead the viewer's eye throughout the composition, enhancing the statue’s emotional impact.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Art during the Renaissance was largely driven by commissions from the wealthy elite, including the church and nobility. This economic disparity meant that art was often inaccessible to the lower classes, reinforcing societal hierarchies. Consequently, the messages within such artworks were not universally shared or interpreted.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While the artwork is not a direct depiction of a disease, the subject of Christ's crucifixion invites contemplation on his physical suffering. The depiction of Christ’s body alludes to conditions associated with crucifixion: potential asphyxiation, blood loss, and severe trauma.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The relaxed muscles and closed eyes of the sculpted Christ signify death. The anatomical precision Michelangelo employed in the depiction of tendons and veins highlights his study of human anatomy, further contributing to the realism of disease or injury portrayal.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Historically, methods of treating crucifixion injuries were nonexistent due to their intended fatal outcome. Michelangelo’s rendering of calm suggests acceptance and sublimation of suffering, representing a spiritual treatment rather than a physical one.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The act of crucifixion as depicted is underscored by its societal role as a punishment reserved for the lowest echelons of society. This highlights issues of justice and inequality existent during the Roman era, with a resonance through societal views on punishment and death.</p>
