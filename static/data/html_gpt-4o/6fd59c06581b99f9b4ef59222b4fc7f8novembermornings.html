        <h2>Art and Analysis</h2>
        <h3>a) Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork titled "November Mornings" is created by an anonymous artist whose details are not disclosed. This piece reflects a blend of fantasy and reality, merging both artistic and biomedical insights into a singular expression.</p>
        
        <h3>b) Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h3>
        <p>Originating in the early 21st century, this artwork belongs to the contemporary period characterized by a fusion of traditional and modern techniques. The socio-cultural context is marked by globalization and the rapid advancements in science and technology, where art increasingly explores themes of health and the human condition.</p>
        
        <h3>c) Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The piece portrays a figure with tree branches extending from its head, symbolizing growth and connection. This iconography is often associated with life, fertility, and interconnectedness with nature. The birds perched on the branches might symbolize freedom or communication, adding layers of meaning regarding interaction between different life forms.</p>
        
        <h3>d) Stylistic Significance</h3>
        <p>The artwork employs surrealistic elements with its fantastical depiction of a human figure intertwined with nature. The principles of design such as balance, contrast, and harmony are evident as the soft textiles are juxtaposed with the rigid form of the branches, creating a dynamic visual experience.</p>
        
        <h3>e) Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>This artwork may subtly reflect upon the disparities in access to healthcare and the divergent experiences of individuals in health systems globally. The intertwined branches could signify the entangled nature of these inequities and their pervasive impact on society.</p>
        
        <h3>f) Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Within this artwork, the disease could metaphorically represent mental health issues, where the branches and crows signify complex thoughts or neural connections. The etiology in a metaphorical sense could allude to stressors from modern societal pressures that manifest in such artistic illustrations.</p>
        
        <h3>g) Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The structural network formed by the branches might represent the detailed pathways of the brain or neural networks affected by mental health conditions. The crows could be signifiers of disturbances or underlying stress.</p>
        
        <h3>h) Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment of the metaphorical illness depicted in the art may involve psychological approaches such as therapy or medication. Moreover, artistic expression itself can be considered a cathartic and therapeutic process for addressing mental health issues.</p>
        
        <h3>i) Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The artwork subtly suggests how social determinants like economic status, education, and environment influence mental health. The intricate design signifies the complex interplay of these factors in shaping one's health and well-being.</p>
