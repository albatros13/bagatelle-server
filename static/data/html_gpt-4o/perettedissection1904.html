        <h1>Perette Dissection 1904</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork in question, titled "Perette Dissection 1904," is attributed to an artist known as Perette. Although little may be known about the artist's personal background or broader body of work, this piece is a rich source of study because of its intricate representation of a surgical procedure at the turn of the 20th century.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 1904, this piece emerges from a period marked by rapid advancements in medical science and education. In the early 20th century, dissections were a crucial part of the medical curriculum, offering unparalleled insights into human anatomy and an understanding of disease processes. The socio-cultural backdrop of this time was the ongoing transformation of medical practices, moving from more traditional approaches to ones rooted in scientific rigor.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The symbolism in “Perette Dissection 1904” revolves around the portrayal of medical knowledge as both an art and a science. The surgical scene depicted is almost ritualistic, emphasizing the intersection of human curiosity with the necessities of medical education. The presence of multiple figures surrounding the deceased hints at the collaborative nature of the field.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork employs a somber palette, suggesting the seriousness of the subject matter. The composition is balanced, with a central focus on the cadaver, immediately drawing the viewer’s eye. There is a deliberate juxtaposition between the stillness of the lifeless body and the meticulous action of the surgeons, underscoring the precision required in medical practice.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During this period, access to medical education and practice was highly exclusive. Medical schools predominantly consisted of European males, with little to no diversity in gender or ethnicity. "Perette Dissection 1904" inadvertently highlights this inequality by illustrating an all-male surgical team, a common practice of the era.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While the artwork does not specify a particular disease, it implies an anatomical quest for understanding ailments that were less understood at the time. Dissections often revealed signs of chronic illnesses, infectious diseases, or congenital anomalies that had remained elusive to surface examinations.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The exposed thoracic and abdominal regions could suggest a focus on diseases affecting the heart, lungs, or digestive organs. The detailed portrayal of these regions in the dissection represents the quest for understanding internal pathologies that manifest in outward symptoms.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments during the early 1900s were becoming more sophisticated, with a move towards techniques informed by antiseptic standards and improved surgical procedures. However, there were still limitations in technology and pharmacology, making empirical anatomical knowledge from dissections indispensable to the surgical practice.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The prevalence and understanding of diseases during this time were heavily influenced by social determinants such as poverty, living conditions, and occupational hazards. Limited access to healthcare further exacerbated health disparities, a theme subtly alluded to by the painting’s setting in a well-equipped operating theatre.</p>
