        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork titled "Severe Swelling of Abdomen" was created by J. Callow in 1868. The piece belongs to a period when medical illustration was a crucial tool for education and understanding. J. Callow was known for his detailed and precise approach, making significant contributions to medical sciences through his illustrations.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>During the mid to late 19th century, artworks like these played a pivotal role in advancing medical knowledge. This period saw significant developments in medical diagnostics and surgical techniques. The use of such detailed and realistic imagery was crucial for medical students and professionals to visually understand complex medical conditions.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The illustration vividly depicts the symbolism of medical vulnerability and human frailty. It serves as a stark reminder of the limit of human resilience against disease and how science endeavors to confront these biological challenges.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork employs realism, focusing on anatomical precision. The use of shading and line work enhances the three-dimensional appearance of the swelling, aiding in a better understanding of the condition depicted. The color palette is subdued, emphasizing the severity and seriousness of the medical condition.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During the 19th century, access to medical education and resources was limited to upper-class individuals, predominantly men. This disparity highlights the socio-cultural inequities of the time. Illustrations like these were accessible primarily in academic and professional circles, limiting broader understanding and awareness.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The illustrated condition represents a severe abdominal swelling, possibly an advanced form of an umbilical or inguinal hernia, or possibly ascites. This could be due to various etiologies such as liver cirrhosis, heart failure, or malignancies leading to fluid accumulation.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Signs in the illustration include a distended abdomen, likely due to fluid accumulation or hernia. Other signifiers could include skin stretching and prominent veins, indicating increased abdominal pressure and potential liver dysfunction.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment during the 19th century for such conditions was limited. Surgical intervention was becoming more common yet carried significant risks due to lack of antisepsis and anesthesia. Modern treatments would involve addressing root causes such as liver disease, using diuretics, or performing safe surgical repairs.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as poor living conditions, lack of access to healthcare, and malnutrition were significant contributors to diseases manifesting as abdominal swellings. The industrial revolution era saw overcrowding in urban areas, leading to increased spread of infections and poor public health.</p>
