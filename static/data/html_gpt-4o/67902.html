        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis of the Artwork</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork depicted is commonly attributed to the Chinese culture, specifically within the tradition of medical sculptures that date back to ancient times. These sculptures often lack a single artist, as they are products of collective cultural craftsmanship and are meant for educational purposes in medical practice.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Originating from the Qing Dynasty period (1644-1912), these anatomical models were used to educate practitioners in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). During this time, there was a significant emphasis on widespread education and dissemination of medical knowledge among practitioners and students.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The sculpture displays acupuncture points, symbolizing the flow of energy, or "Qi," within the human body. Each marked point is associated with channels known as meridians, believed to influence health and wellness in TCM. This model integrates physiological and spiritual symbolism, reflecting the holistic perspective of health in Chinese tradition.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The realistic depiction of human anatomy highlights the craftsmen's attention to detail and understanding of human morphology. The piece employs a naturalistic style, focusing on proportion and anatomical accuracy. The intricate inscribing of acupuncture points demonstrates both the practical and aesthetic harmony prevalent in Chinese medical art.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The creation and circulation of such models often reflected socio-cultural hierarchies, where access to medical knowledge was limited to certain scholars, excluding women and lower classes. This delineation underscored broader societal inequities prevalent during this era.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The acupuncture points inscribed on the model are pertinent to numerous conditions such as digestive disorders, musculoskeletal pains, and stress-related symptoms. TCM posits that the blockage or imbalance of Qi contributes to illness, urging techniques like acupuncture to restore balance.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The meridian-based model addresses several signs of illness, such as tension, pain, and internal discomfort, through tactile stimulation of printed nodes. Each point corresponds to physical and energetic imbalances associated with specific bodily functions or systems.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment in TCM through acupuncture involves penetrating the skin with thin needles at marked points to invigorate the meridians and modulate Qi flow. The efficacy is often integrated with herbal medicine, dietary adjustment, and exercise to consolidate overall healing.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The determinants of health recognized in Chinese tradition extend to environmental harmony, dietary factors, and societal roles. TCM practitioners acknowledge that social stress, lifestyle imbalance, and community dynamics significantly influence health outcomes.</p>
