        <h1>Pellagra: An Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The painting titled "Pellagra" is a poignant depiction of the human condition influenced by disease. The artist behind this masterpiece is not prominently known, yet it gives a voice to the silent suffering endured by many. The depiction is rooted in realistic portrayals common in late 19th to early 20th-century art, capturing the essence of hardship faced by rural communities.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>Pellagra became notably prevalent in Europe and the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s, particularly impacting economically disadvantaged populations. This period, marked by industrialization and social transformation, saw the agricultural industry evolve, often at the expense of the rural poor. The painting embodies this era, reflecting the intersection of malnutrition and poverty.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>Symbolically, the artwork is rife with imagery that underscores suffering and resilience. The depictions of barren fields and an emaciated child signify both the scarcity of resources and the vulnerability of those afflicted by pellagra. The somber color palette further emphasizes the bleak circumstances faced by individuals during this period.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The stylistic execution of this painting utilizes realism and attention to detail to convey a gripping narrative. Elements like texture and contrast are expertly manipulated to bring forth the harsh reality of living with disease. The use of light and shadow enhances the emotional depth, guiding the observer’s focus within the composition.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Pellagra was primarily a disease of poverty, affecting those who were marginalized and without access to a balanced diet. This artwork highlights the inequities in access to health and nutrition, an issue that persists today. The societal neglect of impoverished communities is starkly emphasized, calling for a reflection on historical and continuing disparities.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Pellagra is a nutritional disease caused by a deficiency in niacin (vitamin B3) and is associated with diets deficient in protein, particularly tryptophan. The classic symptoms include dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and if untreated, it can lead to death. Its prevalence was higher in populations subsisting on corn, which lacks adequate nutrients without proper preparation.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The pathology of pellagra can be seen in dermatitis, apparent in the artwork through roughened skin and lethargy depicted on the subjects. This visual portrayal of symptoms is crucial in understanding the severe impact pellagra has on individuals. The progression to cognitive impairment and systemic failure is a reminder of the disease's gravity.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The primary treatment for pellagra involves dietary correction with niacin supplements or foods rich in niacin and tryptophan. During the time this painting represents, there was a lack of knowledge about effective nutritional interventions, leading to widespread morbidity and mortality. Modern treatment is effective, simple, and highlights the necessity of nutritional education.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Pellagra was heavily influenced by social determinants including poverty, education, and access to diverse foods. The individuals depicted in the painting symbolize the struggle against these determinants, underlying the need for systemic change. Education and community support are essential in preventing such nutritional diseases.</p>
