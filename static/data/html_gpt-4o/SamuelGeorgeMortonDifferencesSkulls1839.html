        <h2>Samuel George Morton Differences Skulls (1839)</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</strong><br>
            Samuel George Morton, an American physician and natural scientist, is the creator of this artwork. His work primarily focused on the study of craniometry, examining skulls to assert racial differences.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</strong><br>
            Created in 1839, this artwork is situated in the antebellum period of American history when scientific racism was prevalent. During this time, theories were perpetuated to justify racial inequalities under the guise of scientific inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</strong><br>
            The skulls in Morton's illustration symbolize perceived racial differences. They were used to promote the erroneous idea that certain races were inherently superior or inferior based on cranial capacity and shape, reflecting the pseudoscientific mentality of the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</strong><br>
            The artwork relies on minimalist, scientific illustration techniques. Morton's use of line and contour in depicting the skulls serves to emphasize anatomical differences. The symmetry and precision highlight the supposed objectivity of his scientific approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</strong><br>
            Morton's work contributed to structural racism by using pseudoscience to legitimize social hierarchies. By asserting unsubstantiated racial differences, his studies underpinned discriminatory policies and social practices, exacerbating cultural inequities.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</strong><br>
            Morton's diagrams are not directly related to disease but rather to perceived anatomical differences. The implied 'pathology' is the misguided assumption that cranial shapes correlate with intelligence or capability, which is scientifically invalid.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</strong><br>
            The perceived 'illness' in this context is the attribution of societal dysfunction to biological diversity. The real pathology lies in the lasting impact of Morton's ideas, affecting views on race and intelligence for generations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[h] Treatment</strong><br>
            Rectifying the pseudoscientific claims found in Morton's work involves education and dissemination of accurate anthropological and genetic research. Emphasizing human equality and the sociocultural rather than biological basis for observed differences is crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</strong><br>
            Morton's work reflects deeper social determinants linked to race, such as historical injustices and socioeconomic conditions. These determinants influenced health disparities and access to resources, underscoring the importance of addressing racial bias in science.
