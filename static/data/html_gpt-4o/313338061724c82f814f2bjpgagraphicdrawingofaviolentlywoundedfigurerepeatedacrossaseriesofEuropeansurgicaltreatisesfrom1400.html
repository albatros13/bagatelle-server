        <h2>Analysis of the European Surgical Treatises from the 1400s</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        This illustration is part of a collection of medieval European surgical treatises. Although specific artists are rarely credited, it's likely the work of an artisan trained in medieval manuscript illumination, possibly affiliated with a medical practitioner or scriptorium that specialized in medical texts. 

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        Dating from around the 1400s, this illustration exemplifies the medieval period's integration of art and science. During this time, Europe was experiencing significant developments in medical knowledge, largely influenced by translations of Ancient Greek and Arabic medical texts. This period also coincides with the rise of universities, which led to a more structured approach to medical education.

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        The drawing depicts a figure essentially used as a visual guide for surgical procedures and anatomical study. The open wounds, surgical instruments, and meticulous labeling symbolize both the empirical study of the human body and the practical challenges of medieval surgery. The intent was both to educate and guide practitioners in observational learning.

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        The artwork employs a schematic, diagrammatic style typical of medieval medical manuscripts. Despite its precise detailing, which aligns with didactic purposes, the somewhat rigid and icon-like human figure reflects the era’s stylistic tendencies towards symbolism over realism. The interplay of text and image is central to its design, driving its educational utility.

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        During this period, access to medical education and literature was limited to the educated elite, often clergy or those within university systems. The use of Latin in medical texts further restricted access to knowledge, perpetuating social inequities in healthcare access and literacy.

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        The drawing doesn’t focus specifically on diseases but rather on wounds and trauma, showcasing common injuries encountered during warfare or accidents. These were practical concerns of surgeons who had to deal with battlefield injuries without the benefits of modern surgical techniques and asepsis.

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        The graphic depiction of wounds and embedded surgical instruments serves as a testament to understanding the external manifestations of trauma and injury. It highlights a rudimentary grasp of pathology, focused more on treatment than etiological roots of disease.

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        Treatments during this era were often rudimentary and heavily reliant on physical measures like the removal of foreign objects from wounds, stopping bleeding, and promoting healing through techniques detailed in such illustrations. Herbal remedies and basic antiseptics may have been used, but the underlying infection risks were not fully understood.

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        Illness and injury during medieval times were often exacerbated by social determinants such as poor living conditions, lack of sanitation, and inadequate nutrition. These factors were not recognized or addressed effectively, contributing to the prevalence and severity of diseases and injuries seen in such treatises.
