            <h2>a. Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
            <p>The artwork "Copy of Varieties (5)" is a representation originating from the 18th and 19th-century interest in phrenology and human classification. Although the specific artist is not clear, this piece is reflective of the scientific communities of Europe that were interested in categorizing human skulls as part of their studies on race and characteristics.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>b. Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
            <p>Created during the period when Europe was experiencing significant scientific and intellectual exploration, the artwork was influenced by colonial expansion and the subsequent encounters with various cultures across the globe. The 18th and 19th centuries were marked by an increased interest in human anatomy and the classification of human races, driven by both scientific curiosity and social prejudices.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>c. Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
            <p>The piece uses skulls to symbolize different human races, categorized according to the pseudoscientific beliefs of the time. This categorization often related physical characteristics to personality traits and intelligence, indicative of the prevailing racial theories that sought to establish European supremacy using scientific rationale.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>d. Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
            <p>This artwork utilizes line and form to distinguish between the skulls. The clear linework and lack of color focus attention on the structural differences as perceived by the artists during that time. The use of proportion and balance is evident in the arrangement of the skulls, which were meant to represent the supposed hierarchy among races.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>e. Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
            <p>This piece reinforced social and cultural inequities by visually and pseudoscientifically validating racial discrimination. The dissemination of such imagery contributed to the justification of racial hierarchies, influencing socio-political policies and further entrenching social divides.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>f. Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
            <p>In context to biomedical analysis, the artwork does not directly depict disease. However, it employed scientific rationale to discuss cranial pathology that were believed to indicate intellectual deficiency or cultural superiority hence viewed through the lens of racial science rather than actual pathology.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>g. Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
            <p>There are no specific signs of illness in the skulls depicted; instead, the image reflects pseudo-pathological views that certain cranial features denoted racial deficiencies or virtues, often used to propagate social injustices under the guise of medical science.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>h. Treatment</h2>
            <p>Being a part of racial science, the "treatment" was not medical in the traditional sense but was geared towards societal interventions. This wrongful scientific stance sought to shape societal norms and allow for cultural reforms based on a flawed understanding of race.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>i. Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
            <p>Social determinants included prevailing beliefs in racial superiority and the institutionalization of discrimination. These were often justified using pseudoscientific measures, which exploited societal biases to perpetuate cultural hierarchies and tangible inequities.</p>
