        <h1>Egon Schiele: Gustav Klimt on His Deathbed (1918)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            The artwork "Gustav Klimt on His Deathbed" was created by Egon Schiele, a prominent Austrian artist known for his provocative and emotive style. Schiele was a key figure in early 20th-century Viennese art and was closely associated with the Expressionist movement. His work was characterized by its raw emotional intensity and innovative use of line.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>
            This drawing was completed in 1918, during a turbulent period marked by the end of World War I and the Spanish flu pandemic. Vienna, the city where Schiele lived and worked, was a center for cultural, social, and political change. The upheaval and uncertainty of this era are reflected in Schiele's art, which often explores themes of mortality, sexuality, and existential anxiety.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>
            In "Gustav Klimt on His Deathbed," the subject is depicted with a somber and introspective expression. Klimt's position as a leading figure in the Austrian art scene adds weight to this portrayal. Schiele's choice to capture Klimt at this vulnerable moment speaks to the deep respect and influence Klimt had on him, as well as the tragic loss of life due to the war and disease. The bare, linear quality of the drawing emphasizes the simplicity and inevitability of death.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>
            Schiele's distinctive linear style is evident in this work. The minimalist use of line creates a potent, unembellished portrait that conveys emotion through form and expression rather than color or detail. This approach is a hallmark of Schiele's art, allowing the viewer to focus on the visceral human experience. His masterful use of negative space frames Klimt, leaving a powerful impression of isolation and end-of-life reflection.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            The period marked significant social inequalities exacerbated by the war and the spread of the Spanish flu. The pandemic highlighted disparities in healthcare access, with poorer communities suffering higher mortality rates. Artists like Schiele and Klimt, despite their fame, were not immune to these societal issues, as seen in their focus on themes of death and suffering.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            Klimt's death in 1918 was due in part to the Spanish flu, caused by the H1N1 influenza virus. This pandemic was one of the deadliest in history, spreading rapidly across the globe with devastating impact. It was characterized by severe respiratory symptoms, complications such as pneumonia, and high mortality rates, especially among healthy adults.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            In the portrait, Klimt's gaunt features and weary eyes are indicative of illness. The subtle lines on his face may allude to the debilitating effects of influenza, including severe fatigue and malaise. Schiele's portrayal captures a profound sense of vulnerability and resignation to fate.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            During the 1918 pandemic, medical treatment options were limited. Relief often involved bed rest and supportive care. The lack of antibiotics meant that secondary bacterial infections, common in flu patients, were often fatal. Public health measures included isolation, quarantine, and the use of masks, although their effectiveness was limited by the lack of understanding of viral transmission at the time.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Social determinants such as poverty, living conditions, and access to healthcare played significant roles in the spread and impact of the Spanish flu. Overcrowded living spaces, common in European urban centers during the war, facilitated rapid transmission of the virus. Moreover, wartime disruption strained medical resources, worsening health outcomes for many.
