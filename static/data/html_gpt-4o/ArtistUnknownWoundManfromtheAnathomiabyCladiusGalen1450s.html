        <h2>Wound Man from the Anathomia by Cladius Galen (1450)</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>
            The creator of the "Wound Man" illustration from the Anathomia is unknown, although it is often attributed to Claudius Galen. Galen's influence on medieval medicine was profound, and his anatomical sketches provided a foundation for later artists and physicians. However, "Wound Man" was likely created by a medieval scribe or illustrator whose main intention was to educate and guide medical practitioners.
        </p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>
            The Wound Man illustration dates back to the 15th century, a period rich in anatomic exploration prompted by the Renaissance. This era was marked by a renewed interest in classical knowledge, humanism, and the intricate study of the human body. Medical practices were being documented more rigorously and shared across Europe, crucially through the burgeoning use of the printing press.
        </p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>
            "Wound Man" serves as both a diagnostic tool and a symbolic representation of the human body's vulnerability. Icons such as swords, arrows, and other weapons showcase common medieval battle injuries. Each wound drives the viewer to consider the fragility of life and the body’s susceptibility to injury and disease, reflecting the period's societal challenges and constant exposure to injury through conflict.
        </p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>
            Stylistically, the image is straightforward and functional. The illustration emphasizes clarity over artistic flourish, ensuring that each injury is discernible. The design effectively uses contrast in colors and meticulous labeling in Latin to provide comprehensive medical insights. The figure's slightly exaggerated features serve to emphasize areas of injury and treatment.
        </p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>
            This artifact emerges from a time when access to medical knowledge was severely inequitable. Only trained physicians or elite patrons usually had the privilege of accessing such illustrations. The poor and disenfranchised often lacked basic medical care, relying instead on traditional remedies or the benevolence of more knowledgeable community figures.
        </p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>
            The diseases depicted may include infections resulting from battlefield injuries, as indicated by arrows and sword wounds. The "Wound Man" acts as an educational tool indicating both the apparent cause and assumed etiologies linked to medieval surgical and therapeutic practices, highlighting the historical perception of external and traumatic causes of disease.
        </p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>
            Visible signs of pathology are illustrated through the various wounds marked on the body. These include penetrations, lacerations, and contusions, all potential sites for infections or sepsis. The inclusion of surgical tools indicates the medieval attempts to not only diagnose but also to treat such injuries with the limited medical understanding of the time.
        </p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>
            Treatments during this period commonly involved herbal remedies, cauterization, and primitive surgical techniques. This illustration could help doctors plan their approach to care, with detailed instructions accompanying the wounds, insinuating procedures for dealing with such injuries—the forerunner to surgical manuals.
        </p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>
            The constant military conflicts and unsanitary conditions of medieval life significantly contributed to the prevalence of injuries and infections. While nobility could claim better healthcare, common people faced significant challenges due to their socio-economic status, which exacerbated health disparities and outcomes.
