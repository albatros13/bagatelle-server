        <h1>Bible Depiction of a Couple Suffering from the Blisters of Bubonic Plague</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This artwork is an anonymous creation, representative of medieval European religious manuscripts. Artists of these times often worked within monasteries, creating illustrations to accompany biblical texts. These depictions served both artistic and educational purposes in a largely illiterate society.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The image is from the 15th century, a period marked by the recurrent outbreaks of the bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death. The pandemic had a profound impact on socio-cultural structures, devastating populations, and transforming the economic and social landscape of Europe. This period saw a high degree of religiosity and superstition, reflected in the art and literature of the time.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The depiction uses iconography typical of medieval art. The figures are shown with an emphasis on their suffering, as indicated by the presence of buboes. The detached figure scattering something over the afflicted couple could symbolize divine intervention or the fatalistic spread of disease. The artwork underscores the Judeo-Christian belief in suffering and redemption.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>This image exemplifies medieval manuscript art with its use of vivid coloration and lack of perspective. The artist employs a flat, two-dimensional style with bright colors to emphasize the scene. Line and color are dominant, creating stark outlines of figures for clarity and exaggeration of the morbid theme.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During the plague, significant socio-cultural inequities were exposed. The wealthy had more means to flee from affected areas and access care, while the poor suffered greatly. Social stigma was attached to those infected, reminiscent of how infectious diseases disproportionately affect marginalized groups.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The bubonic plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, transmitted through fleas typically carried by rodents. The disease manifests as swollen lymph nodes (buboes), fever, chills, and prostration, indicative of its aggressive spread and high mortality rate.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The artwork vividly illustrates a couple with the characteristic signs of the bubonic plague: lesions or "buboes" on their body. These painful swellings were often blackened due to necrosis, lending to the term "Black Death." Such visual signifiers played a role in contemporary medical understanding.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment during the medieval period was primitive, often based on superstition. Standard responses included bloodletting, use of herbal concoctions, and religious penance. Isolation of the sick and quarantine measures, however, were early forms of effectively controlling the disease spread.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>In the context of the plague, overcrowding, poor sanitation, and malnutrition played vital roles in exacerbating the disease's impact. Societal disruptions, such as war and trade, facilitated spread. Understanding these determinants remains crucial in addressing modern pandemics.</p>
