        <section>
            <h2>[a] Artist</h2>
            <p>Edward Munch, a pivotal Norwegian painter, is best known for his symbolic and expressionistic approach to art. His work often explores the depths of human emotion and existential anxiety, reflective of his own tumultuous life experiences.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
            <p>“Self Portrait with Spanish Flu” was painted in 1919, a time beset by the devastation of the Spanish Flu pandemic. This pandemic had a profound global impact, coinciding with the post-World War I era, a period marked by political upheaval and social change.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>[c] Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
            <p>The painting captures Munch in a vulnerable state, emphasizing his battle with illness. The use of dark, swirling colors symbolizes the chaos and turmoil of his condition, while his sunken expression signifies the existential dread imposed by the pandemic.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance</h2>
            <p>Munch's style in this painting is expressionistic, with visible brushstrokes and an emphasis on the emotional experience over realism. The distorted forms and dynamic lines draw the viewer into Munch’s precarious psychological state.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
            <p>The Spanish Flu disproportionately affected lower socio-economic classes, illustrating stark inequalities in healthcare access. Similar to contemporary pandemics, those marginalized were more severely impacted, lacking proper medical care and living in crowded conditions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
            <p>The Spanish Flu, caused by the H1N1 influenza virus, originated in birds and mutated to infect humans. Rapidly transmitted through respiratory droplets, its symptoms included fever, body aches, and severe respiratory distress.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
            <p>In the painting, Munch’s pallor and sallow cheeks reflect clinical signs of the infection. The fatigue and weakness manifest in his posture and facial expression, mirroring the debilitating impact of the disease.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
            <p>Treatment during the Spanish Flu pandemic was limited, focusing largely on symptomatic relief. Isolation, bed rest, and hydration were the primary recommendations, as antibiotics and antiviral drugs were unavailable at the time.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
            <p>The spread of the Spanish Flu was exacerbated by wartime conditions, including troop movements and poor sanitation. Social factors, such as crowded living situations and inadequate healthcare infrastructure, further facilitated its rapid transmission.</p>
