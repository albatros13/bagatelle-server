        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis of the Artwork</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork’s precise artist is not definitively identifiable from the available information. However, the setting indicates the possibility of a work crafted during a time when collective artists or groups were commissioned to capture urban and everyday scenes. It may pertain to a school of thought or likely an anonymous group looking to depict socio-cultural occurrences of an era through the art of the common populace.</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h3>
        <p>This painting appears to be set in a period somewhere between the 17th and 18th centuries—a time known for the juxtaposition between opulence and emerging urban poverty in European societies. Cities expanded with an influx of people seeking economic opportunity, which often led to cramped living conditions and the spread of diseases, reflecting vividly through art.</p>
        
        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The image showcases a chaotic assemblage of figures and architecture, symbolizing societal strife and the invisible forces of social and economic disparity. The central statue may infer long-standing traditions overshadowed by the realities of the common people’s daily survival struggles.</p>
        
        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>The use of light and shadow guides the viewer through the visual narrative, highlighting the contrasts between the imposing architecture and the huddled figures. The structure in the background alludes to permanence amidst the transitory human conditions portrayed in the foreground. These elements create a balanced yet dynamic composition emphasizing movement and realism.</p>
        
        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The artwork offers a stark portrayal of class disparities prevalent during its depicted time. The varied states of attire and activity amongst the figures suggest a hierarchy in societal roles and economic standing. Such depictions hint at broader commentaries on the lack of social mobility and the persistent nature of inequality.</p>
        
        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Visible are signs of physical affliction among some of the individuals, suggestive of a rampant disease during that period. Common ailments affecting urban centers then included the plague, tuberculosis, or other infectious diseases accelerated by poor sanitation and overcrowded environments.</p>
        
        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The postures and expressions of certain figures indicate fatigue, pain, and despondency, often linked with symptomatic manifestations of diseases prevalent at the time. Observations may include swollen limbs, open sores, or exhaustion, reflecting the intense public health challenges of urban living then.</p>
        
        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatments during this era were rudimentary by today’s standards, often relying on herbal concoctions or superstitions rather than empirical evidence. The absence of advanced medical knowledge meant that cures were speculative, with much reliance on basic care or isolation when dealing with contagious diseases.</p>
        
        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The piece highlights how economic instability, inadequate housing, and poor nutrition often exacerbated health conditions. These are reflections of broader social determinants where individuals in poorer communities had lesser access to healthcare and lived in environments conducive to the spread of illness.</p>
