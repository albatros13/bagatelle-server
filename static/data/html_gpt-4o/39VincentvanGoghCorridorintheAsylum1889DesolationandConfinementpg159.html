        <h1>Vincent van Gogh Corridor in the Asylum Desolation and Confinement (1889)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Vincent van Gogh, a post-impressionist painter from the Netherlands, is one of the most famous figures in Western art history. Despite his struggles with mental health, he produced over 2,100 artworks, including about 860 oil paintings, most of which were created in the last two years of his life.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>This painting was created in 1889 while Van Gogh was residing at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France. During this period, mental asylums were often places of confinement rather than healing, reflecting societal attitudes towards mental illness at the time.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting symbolizes the isolation and desolation Van Gogh experienced during his time in the asylum. The long, empty corridor reflects a sense of endless confinement. The use of contrasting colors and distorted perspective may represent Van Gogh’s perception of his surroundings and his emotional state during this period.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Van Gogh's style is characterized by bold brush strokes, vibrant colors, and emotive impact. In "Corridor in the Asylum," he uses these elements to communicate the psychological tension of the space. The dynamic, swirling lines and color contrasts create a sense of movement and emotional depth.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting indirectly highlights the societal marginalization of individuals with mental health issues during the 19th century. The asylum system often failed to provide humane treatment, reflecting broader social inequities and the stigma surrounding mental illness at the time.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Van Gogh suffered from severe mental health issues, possibly including bipolar disorder, depression, and epilepsy. The exact etiology of his condition is unknown, but contributing factors may have included genetic predisposition, substance abuse, and psychosocial stressors.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The anxiety and turmoil in Van Gogh's work often mirrored his psychological struggles. In "Corridor in the Asylum," the distorted perspective and stark, empty space may symbolize his internal desolation and feeling of entrapment.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment during Van Gogh's time was primitive by modern standards. Patients in asylums were often subjected to confinement and rudimentary medical care. Van Gogh himself sought relief through painting, which provided an outlet for his emotional expression.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Van Gogh’s mental health struggles were compounded by various social determinants, including isolation, financial instability, and inadequate access to effective mental health care. These factors contributed to the exacerbation of his condition.</p>
