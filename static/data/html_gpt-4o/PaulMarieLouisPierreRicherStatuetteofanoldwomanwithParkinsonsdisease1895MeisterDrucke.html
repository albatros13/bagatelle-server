        <h1>Art and Science Analysis</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Paul Marie Louis Pierre Richer was a renowned French artist and sculptor, best known for his intricate works that vividly capture both the physical and emotional essence of his subjects. Active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Richer was also an educator and a committed student of human anatomy, a passion that deeply informed his artistic practice.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>The statuette 'Statuette of an Old Woman with Parkinson's Disease' created in 1895, was developed during a period when medicine and art were increasingly intersecting. The late 19th century saw significant advancements in medical understanding and Richer's work reflects a burgeoning curiosity about human pathophysiology from an artistic perspective. Richer often depicted medical conditions to explore the vulnerable aspects of human nature.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>Richer's statuette symbolizes the frailty and resilience of the human spirit, with Parkinson’s disease representing an internal struggle manifesting outwardly. The exaggerated posture and the detailed depiction of the figure's muscles and bones serve as a visual lexicon of human suffering, drawing attention to the lived experience of illness.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>This piece is an exemplar of Richer's deftness with human anatomy, highlighting realism and attention to detail. The statuette’s proportions, texture, and posture are masterfully crafted to convey both physicality and emotion, with the design principles of balance and emphasis effectively drawing focus to the posture indicative of Parkinson’s disease.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>By focusing on an elderly woman with Parkinson’s disease, Richer opens a conversation about aging and medical inequities. During the 19th century, elderly individuals, particularly women, often faced marginalization with limited access to healthcare. This work subtly critiques the socio-cultural biases that deprive certain demographics of dignity and care.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Parkinson’s disease is a progressive nervous system disorder affecting movement. Characterized by tremors, rigidity, and postural instability, Parkinson’s primarily results from the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. Although much is known about the disease, its underlying causes remain a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The classic signs of Parkinson’s disease captured in the statuette include the forward-bent posture and rigid limbs. Richer’s detailed rendering showcases the muscular tension and joint stiffness typical of Parkinson’s, making it an invaluable artistic record of medical symptoms.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>In Richer's time, treatments for Parkinson’s were limited to rudimentary approaches aimed mostly at symptomatic relief. Today, management includes pharmacological treatments like levodopa, surgical interventions such as deep brain stimulation, and supportive therapies that aim to maintain quality of life.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Economic status, social support systems, and access to healthcare significantly determine the quality of care and life for individuals with Parkinson’s. Richer’s representation becomes a reflection not only of the biological realities but also the societal implications of living with a chronic condition during the era.</p>
