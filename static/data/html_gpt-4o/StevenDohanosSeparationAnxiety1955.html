        <h1>Steven Dohanos - Separation Anxiety (1955)</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Steven Dohanos was one of America's most significant illustrators, widely recognized for his contribution to the Saturday Evening Post. His work often depicted the everyday life of American society, capturing the nuances and sentimentality of post-war America. Dohanos belonged to the group of artists known as the "social realists," focusing on creating practical and relatable artwork for mass public consumption.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The artwork created in 1955 reflects the era of post-war America, a time marked by social change and economic growth. The mid-20th century saw a shift towards nuclear family structures and the growing anxiety concerning modernization and child-rearing. This cultural context significantly influences the imagery and themes portrayed in Dohanos's work.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting illustrates a pediatric waiting room, a setting familiar to many parents. The expressive body language in the artwork highlights a child's anxiety about separation, a universal theme that symbolizes parental concern, care, and societal expectations. The nurse, children, and parents in various states of interaction subtly comment on the roles of caregivers and the vulnerability of children.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Dohanos's style is notable for its realistic attention to detail, capturing the essence of everyday life through balanced composition and a harmonious color palette. The use of perspective draws the viewer into the scene, allowing them to observe the interactions and emotions within the environment closely. His illustrations typically employed strong linearity and vibrant yet soothing colors, reflecting the era's optimistic yet cautious mood.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The image underscores social dynamics, especially concerning women's roles as primary caregivers, a position often taken for granted and undervalued. In post-war America, women were expected to manage home life, leading to intense debates over the gender roles within the family unit. This cultural snapshot implicitly critiques societal inequities of the time.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While not overtly addressing a specific medical condition, the theme of "separation anxiety" aligns with pediatric studies exploring emotional disorders in children. Separation Anxiety Disorder is characterized by excessive fear or stress due to separation from attachment figures. While the artwork doesn't diagnose, it visualizes the associated emotion effectively.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Observable signs of separation anxiety include the depicted child's reluctance to leave their parent, clinging behavior, and visible distress. The artwork effectively portrays these symptoms, inviting viewers to consider emotional health as a crucial component of pediatric care.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment approaches for separation anxiety involve cognitive-behavioral therapy, family therapy, and parental training to manage and ease the child’s anxiety. Such interventions aim to reinforce positive coping mechanisms and lessen the emotional impact of separation events.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Socio-economic factors, family dynamics, and educational environments significantly influence the development and intensity of separation anxiety in children. In the 1950s, limited awareness and resources for mental health might have contributed to inadequate support systems for affected families.</p>
