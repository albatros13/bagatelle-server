    <h1>St Gulthric Expels a Demon (1210)</h1>
    
    <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
    <p>This artwork is attributed to an anonymous medieval monk or scribe, reflecting the collaborative and often unnamed creation processes of medieval religious manuscripts. The artwork is a fine representation of the manuscript art style that was prevalent during this period, found in large part in religious settings across Europe.</p>

    <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
    <p>The artwork dates back to the early 13th century, a time when the medieval Catholic Church held significant influence over both spiritual and everyday life. During this period, manuscripts often depicted elements of divine intervention against evil forces, reflecting the prevalent belief in demonic possession and sin.</p>

    <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
    <p>The image uses religious symbolism that was common during the medieval age. St. Gulthric, depicted in the artwork, expels a demon as a symbol of spiritual purification and divine power. The demon represents vice and ill-health, while St. Gulthric embodies the purity and authority of the divine.</p>

    <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
    <p>The manuscript's style is characterized by its linear quality and limited palette, typical of medieval manuscript art. The figures are flat and heavily outlined, which lends them a clarity that was crucial for conveying religious narratives. Despite the limited color palette, careful attention has been paid to the symbolic elements like the demon's grotesque features, contrasting with the serene expression of St. Gulthric.</p>

    <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
    <p>The context of the artwork reflects societal norms where religious authority dictated moral standards. The emphasis on demonic possession and its expulsion highlights the church's role in defining and controlling spiritual health. Individuals did not possess agency over spiritual matters; rather, clergy and saints held the power to intercede on their behalf.</p>

    <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
    <p>In medieval times, what modern medicine might diagnose as neurological or mental health disorders were often attributed to demonic possession. Symptoms such as seizures, hallucinations, or irrational behavior were primarily considered manifestations of possession by evil spirits.</p>

    <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
    <p>Signs depicted in this artwork, indicative of possession, may include the physical contortion of figures and the presence of malevolent entities. These reflect a misunderstanding of medical symptoms, often conflating them with spiritual afflictions. The grotesque demon symbolizes the perceived physical presence of illness.</p>

    <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
    <p>Treatment of such conditions in the medieval era involved spiritual rituals, such as exorcisms conducted by clergy, who would use prayers, holy water, and relics to rid the afflicted of their ailments. Medical treatment as understood today was largely absent, with reliance on spiritual rather than empirical methods.</p>

    <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
    <p>The absence of medical knowledge, coupled with the church’s influence, meant illnesses were often explained through a spiritual lens. This art reveals how social perceptions and religious beliefs shaped the understanding and treatment of diseases, which were often feared and misunderstood.</p>
