        <h1>Lucas Cranach the Elder - Melancholy</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Lucas Cranach the Elder, an influential German Renaissance painter, was known for his court portraits and mythological scenes. His works are recognized for their dexterous use of color and attention to fine detail. Cranach was affiliated with the Protestant Reformation through his association with Martin Luther.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>The artwork "Melancholy" was created in 1532, a time when the Protestant Reformation was drastically altering the religious and cultural landscape of Europe. The Renaissance era marked a revival in classical learning and a surge in artistic innovation. It was an era of tumultuous change and intense intellectual curiosity.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting exhibits rich symbolism related to the concept of melancholy. The central figure surrounded by objects such as the sphere and set of scales allude to themes of balance and scientific inquiry. The celestial elements further signify the Renaissance interest in astrology and the human psyche.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Cranach’s use of vibrant coloring and intricate detailing adds depth to the artwork. The composition employs symmetry and proportion, drawing attention towards the melancholic figure. Light and shadow are adroitly balanced, highlighting the art’s reflective ethos.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The 16th century was marked by pronounced social stratification, which is subtly mirrored in Cranach’s art. While his paintings largely catered to the affluent, they captured everyday human emotions, making profound statements on the commonalities and disparities existent in society.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>In the context of artwork, "melancholy" refers both to a temperament and a form of melancholy illness, known historically as a disorder involving excessive black bile according to the ancient humoral theory. It was believed to affect the body and mind, causing depression or existential contemplation.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The lethargic posture of the central figure captures the essence of melancholy as described in medical and literary traditions, embodying lethargy, contemplation, and withdrawal from the outer world. The enclosed, tidy setting denotes an inward-turning mind, a characteristic of the melancholic state.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments during Cranach’s time for melancholy involved dietary changes, engaging in physical activities, and seeking religious or philosophical counsel. Herbal concoctions with calming properties were also common, as were attempts to balance humors through bleeding or purging.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Melancholy was thought to be influenced by one’s social environment and lifestyle. Stressful living conditions, academic pursuits, and social status were seen as contributors. Economic and power hierarchies further shaped people’s access to remedies and treatments.</p>
