        <h1>Norman Rockwell - Before the Shot</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>
            Norman Rockwell, an American painter and illustrator, is renowned for his depictions of everyday life. Rockwell's association with The Saturday Evening Post for over four decades produced some of his most beloved works, characterized by a distinctive blend of realism and whimsy.
        </p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>
            Painted in 1958, "Before the Shot" reflects post-war America, a period marked by optimism and burgeoning modernity. During this era, there was a keen focus on family life and community, with healthcare becoming more accessible. The painting captures the essence of routine medical practice as part of societal norms.
        </p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>
            The painting illustrates a tender moment between a doctor and a young patient, symbolizing trust and care. The child’s curious expression and the doctor's preparation signify the blend of innocence and professionalism. It propounds a sense of safety and assurance within the clinical environment.
        </p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>
            Rockwell’s realism is vivid, with meticulous attention to detail. The composition’s balance is evident in the spatial arrangement of elements, and the subdued color palette enhances the intimate atmosphere. Rockwell’s technique highlights human emotion through facial expressions and body language.
        </p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>
            While the painting portrays a seemingly idyllic healthcare system, it glosses over the disparities present during the time. In 1958, access to healthcare varied widely along socio-economic lines, with significant groups lacking the comprehensive care depicted in Rockwell’s work.
        </p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>
            The scene suggests a routine immunization, common in the 1950s, as a method to prevent infectious diseases such as polio and measles. This period marked major public health campaigns aimed at eradicating these diseases through widespread vaccination.
        </p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            There are no overt signs of illness depicted in the artwork; rather, it is preventive medicine that is being symbolized. The shot is indicative of efforts to combat diseases before they occur, rather than addressing visible symptoms.
        </p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Vaccination is highlighted as a primary prevention strategy. By immunizing children, the medical community aimed to safeguard against outbreaks, contributing to public health and societal well-being.
        </p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>
            Access to healthcare, highlighted in Rockwell’s painting, was largely influenced by socio-economic status and geographic location. Communities with limited resources often had reduced access to vaccinations and healthcare that those in more affluent areas took for granted.
