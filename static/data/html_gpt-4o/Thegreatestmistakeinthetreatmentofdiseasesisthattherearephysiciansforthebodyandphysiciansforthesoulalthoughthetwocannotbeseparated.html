        <h1>The greatest mistake in the treatment of diseases</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artist behind this evocative piece is Barbara Hepworth, a renowned figure in the art world known for her abstract sculptures and drawings. Born in Yorkshire, England, in 1903, Hepworth emerged as a leading figure in the modernist movement. Her works often explore themes of human existence, the duality of body and soul, and the interconnectedness of life.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 1948, this piece belongs to a period post-World War II where the world was grappling with recovery and redefinition. The era was marked by advancements in technology and medicine, but also by philosophical inquiries into the nature of humanity and the universe, reflecting a time of change and modernization in both thought and practice.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or iconography</h2>
        <p>This artwork symbolically intertwines the elements of human anatomy with ethereal lines and forms, suggesting the inseparability of the physical and spiritual. The use of hands, motifs often by Hepworth, signify creation, healing, and the connection between the corporeal and the intangible.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Hepworth employs a minimalist approach with fluid line work, creating a sense of continuity and flow. The nuanced tonal variations and textural elements provide depth, allowing the viewer to explore the interplay between the tactile and the invisible.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During the time this artwork was created, medical and social systems were rife with inequities. Access to healthcare was not universal, and Hepworth’s work subtly comments on the disparity between physical treatment and emotional well-being, highlighting the need for holistic approaches in health care that were often accessible only to privileged classes.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The artwork indirectly explores the theme of holistic health, possibly addressing psychosomatic conditions—disorders that involve both mind and body. The title emphasizes the connection between mental and physical health, critiquing the fragmented approach to treatment.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Through abstract representation, the artwork may suggest the symptoms of imbalance or disharmony between body and spirit. The gestural lines and positioning of forms could symbolize the stress and psychological burden that manifest as physical ailments.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Implied within the drawing is the notion of integrated treatment approaches, where mental health is considered alongside physical health, embodying the holistic philosophies gaining traction mid-20th century but traditionally underrepresented in conventional medical practices.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The artwork reflects on how social conditions—such as war, poverty, and inequality—affect health. The lack of access to cohesive treatment approaches is indicative of the wider discrepancies in societal structure, affecting the overall well-being of individuals within certain socio-economic strata.</p>
