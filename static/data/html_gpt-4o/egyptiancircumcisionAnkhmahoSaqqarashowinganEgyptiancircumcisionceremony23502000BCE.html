        <h2>Ankhmaho Saqqara: The Egyptian Circumcision Ceremony</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork depicting the Egyptian circumcision ceremony is attributed to artisans and scribes of ancient Egypt. Although individual artists are often anonymous, the craftsmen responsible for these works were skilled members of a sophisticated society that undertook monumental projects.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h3>
        <p>This artwork originates from approximately 2350-2000 BCE, a period that encompasses the late Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom in ancient Egypt. During this era, Egypt was characterized by a highly structured societal hierarchy and an emphasis on ceremonies and rituals, particularly within religious and medical practices.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The ceremony depicted signifies a rite of passage and cultural initiation. In ancient Egypt, circumcision represented purification, discipline, and societal inclusion. Iconographically, the surrounding symbols and characters in the depiction serve as protective and guiding elements, ensuring the ritual’s sanctity.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>The artwork demonstrates hallmark elements of ancient Egyptian art, such as the use of hieratic scale, where important figures are depicted larger, and the composite view, combining profile and frontal perspectives. This stylistic approach imbued the scene with clarity and symbolic meaning relatable to viewers at the time.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The practice of circumcision in ancient Egypt was not universally standard across all societal levels. While elites often partook in such rites, the lower classes might not, underscoring the societal stratification and connected privileges within this civilization.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>In the context of circumcision, the artwork does not depict a specific disease but represents a preventive medical practice. Circumcision, at its core, was seen as a hygienic measure, which ties into broader health practices of the Egyptian society to prevent infection and disease.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The depiction lacks direct visual signifiers of illness but embodies an ancient understanding of health management and disease prevention. This ritual signifies an attempt to mitigate risks associated with infections through ritual purification.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Circumcision was both a cultural rite and an early form of surgical intervention. The procedure would have been performed with tools appropriate to the time, accompanied by rituals aimed at ensuring divine protection and success of the treatment.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The prominence of circumcision in Egyptian society underscores how religious beliefs and social status influenced health practices. Access to such rituals often depended on one’s social standing, suggesting that health practices were intertwined with societal hierarchy.</p>
