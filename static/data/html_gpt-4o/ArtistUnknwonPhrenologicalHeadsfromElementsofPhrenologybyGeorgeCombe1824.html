        <h1>Phrenological Heads from Elements of Phrenology by George Combe (1824)</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
            <p>The artwork, while titled after George Combe's influential 1824 book, "Elements of Phrenology," is attributed to an unknown artist. Combe, though not the creator, was instrumental in popularizing phrenology, a pseudoscience that attempted to link skull morphology with psychological traits.</p>

            <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
            <p>This illustration originates from the early 19th century, a period when phrenology gained traction among certain scientific and social circles. The Industrial Revolution was transforming societies, alongside burgeoning interest in sciences and philosophies that tried to make sense of human nature. Phrenology emerged alongside these developments, reflecting societal quests for classification and understanding of human behavior.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
            <p>This artwork symbolically represents the brain and its functions as mapped onto the skull. The various numbered areas denote different personality traits, emotions, and intellectual capabilities according to phrenological beliefs. This partitioning symbolizes the effort to categorize human traits scientifically, though such connections have since been debunked.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
            <p>The drawing utilizes detailed line work and labeling for clarity and instruction. Its simple composition focuses on careful illustration of head profiles and the numbered cranial areas, allowing viewers to easily navigate the proposed phrenological concepts. This conciseness and clarity aim to convey scientific legitimacy.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
            <p>Phrenology was often misused to justify social hierarchies and racial inequalities. It erroneously suggested that certain skull shapes indicated intelligence and moral standing, inadvertently giving a pseudoscientific veneer to discriminatory practices.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
            <p>In phrenological terms, "disease" could be misleadingly defined as moral or intellectual failings based on skull features. The etiology would involve these features purportedly influencing one’s predispositions and behaviors, which we now understand to be scientifically invalid.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
            <p>The supposed "signs" of pathology in phrenology included bumps and indentations on the skull, believed to indicate deficiencies or excesses in faculties such as combativeness or benevolence. These interpretations were speculative and not grounded in factual medical science.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
            <p>Treatments proposed within the framework of phrenology were often behavioral modifications, such as developing underutilized faculties. This could involve activities to stimulate the areas of the brain thought to govern certain traits, although such interventions had no real efficacy.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
            <p>Among the key social determinants promoted by phrenology was the misleading belief that physical characteristics dictated social and moral behavior. This perspective overlooked true social determinants like environment, education, and economic status, instead attributing disparities to immutable physical traits.</p>
