        <h1>Art Historical and Medical Analysis of the Zodiac Man</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork in question, often referred to as the "Zodiac Man," is an illustration typical of medieval and early modern European medical manuscripts. While this specific artwork is associated with Indian art, the concept originated in European astrology and medicine. The artist remains unknown, but the depiction reflects the synthesis of astrological and anatomical knowledge.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The Zodiac Man became a common motif during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, periods when astrology was intertwined with medical practice. This artwork likely reflects the increased interest in integrating astrological insights with medical knowledge during this time. The context suggests a synthesis of Indian and European medical thought.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The Zodiac Man illustration is rich in symbolism, depicting the human body as influenced by the zodiac signs. Each sign is believed to govern particular body parts, influencing health and disease. This connection exemplifies the belief in cosmic forces impacting human health.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Stylistically, the Zodiac Man is characterized by its primitive yet detailed representation. The use of watercolors or inks on parchment or paper provides a sense of antiquity. The layout balances anatomical details with astrological symbolism, integrating intricate line work and symbolic icons to convey complex ideas.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The representation of human anatomy through astrological signs reflects the societal reliance on astrological interpretations for medical guidance. Such practices were accessible largely to those who could afford astrological consultations or medical treatments derived therefrom, highlighting existing social inequities in medical access.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The Zodiac Man illustration does not explicitly depict a disease but implies that health conditions can be influenced by celestial bodies. The assumption of an astrological impact on disease reflects the lack of empirical understanding of etiology during the artwork's time.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Incorporating elements representing astrological signs, the Zodiac Man suggests that each sign correlates with specific health vulnerabilities. The artwork serves more as a conceptual tool rather than a diagnostic diagram, as it does not depict pathology explicitly.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The advocacy for medical treatments based on astrological alignments suggests reliance on celestial events for healing processes. Treatments likely included balancing humors, using herbs, and performing surgeries at astrologically auspicious times.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Astrological beliefs shaped the medical practices of the time, influencing the public’s understanding of health. The reliance on astrology for health advice reveals how cultural narratives can dictate societal health behaviors, potentially limiting the development of scientific approaches to medicine.</p>
