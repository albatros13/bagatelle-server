        <h2>Analysis of Artwork: Stroke</h2>

        <h3>a. Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork titled "Stroke" is attributed to the early 19th-century artist Richard Tennant Cooper, known for his intricate depictions of medical conditions and their societal implications. Cooperaimed to blend artistic expression with scientific inquiry, bringing light to medical concerns within an artistic framework.</p>

        <h3>b. Historical and Socio-Cultural context</h3>
        <p>Created during the early 1800s, this piece reflects a time when medical science was rapidly evolving. The industrial revolution was transforming society, bringing about both progress and challenges. During this era, strokes and other vascular diseases were poorly understood but increasingly prevalent due to changing lifestyles brought on by urbanization and industrial work.</p>

        <h3>c. Symbolism and/or iconography</h3>
        <p>The central figure, likely suffering from a stroke, represents vulnerability and the sudden nature of medical crises. Objects in the background, such as bottles and medical instruments, symbolize the era's developing medical practices, while the surrounding individuals depict societal roles in caregiving and diagnosis.</p>

        <h3>d. Stylistic Significance</h3>
        <p>Cooper's use of line and color emphasizes the stark reality of illness. The contrasting dark and light tones highlight the tension between life and death, health and illness. The detailed depiction of the patient's slackness vs. the attendant's alertness speaks to the dynamic shifts experienced during a stroke.</p>

        <h3>e. Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The artwork subtly highlights social inequities of the time. Access to medical care was largely restricted to the affluent, as suggested by the refined setting. The depiction raises awareness about the disparity between different social classes in receiving timely and adequate medical attention.</p>

        <h3>f. Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>A stroke, or cerebrovascular accident, occurs when blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from receiving oxygen and nutrients. This commonly results from blocked arteries (ischemic stroke) or bursting of blood vessels (hemorrhagic stroke).</p>

        <h3>g. Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Clinically, strokes present with sudden weakness or paralysis, particularly on one side of the body, difficulty speaking, vision problems, and severe headache. Cooper’s artwork effectively captures the physical droop and unconsciousness indicative of a major vascular event.</p>

        <h3>h. Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment varies between types of strokes. Ischemic strokes might necessitate clot-dissolving medication or mechanical removal of the blockage, while hemorrhagic strokes require managing bleeding and reducing brain pressure. Rehabilitation plays a crucial role in recovery.</p>

        <h3>i. Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Factors such as income level, education, and access to healthcare significantly influence the risk and outcomes of a stroke. During Cooper's time, limited medical knowledge compounded these issues, making preventative and therapeutic measures a luxury for the few.</p>
