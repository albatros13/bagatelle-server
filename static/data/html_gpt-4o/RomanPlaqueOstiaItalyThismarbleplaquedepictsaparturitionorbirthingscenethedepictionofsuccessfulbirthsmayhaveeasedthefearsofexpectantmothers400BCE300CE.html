        <h1>Roman Plaque Ostia Italy</h1>
        <p><strong>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe:</strong></p>
        <p>This marble plaque is an anonymous piece likely crafted by Roman artisans specializing in sculptural reliefs during the Ancient Roman period. Such artisans typically belonged to guilds or worked under the patronage of wealthy individuals or governmental entities. The artistic style aligns with the traditional techniques of Roman sculpture which emphasized realism and detail, particularly in representing human figures.</p>

        <p><strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame):</strong></p>
        <p>The plaque dates from 400 BCE to 300 CE, a period marked by the Roman Republic transitioning into the Roman Empire. This was a time of significant social and political upheaval, with expanding territories and an emphasis on cultural assimilation and integration. Public art was employed both for decoration and as propaganda, highlighting aspects of everyday life, mythology, and religious practices. Birthing scenes were depicted to emphasize fertility and the continuation of Roman lineage.</p>

        <p><strong>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography:</strong></p>
        <p>The depiction of childbirth on this plaque symbolizes the vital role of women in Roman society as bearers of new life and continuance of family lineage. The serene expression of the portrayed figures is indicative of successful childbirth, which may have served to comfort expectant mothers and reinforce the capability and strength attributed to women in Roman culture. Additionally, the presence of attendants may represent the importance of community support and the medical knowledge of the time.</p>

        <p><strong>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design):</strong></p>
        <p>This relief is notable for its use of linearity and depth to create a dynamic narrative scene in bas-relief. The figures are crafted with a high degree of anatomical realism, a hallmark of Roman sculpture which was often influenced by earlier Greek art. The arrangement creates a focal point centered on the birthing mother, using techniques such as overlapping and proportionate scaling to give a sense of spatial depth despite the medium's inherent flatness.</p>

        <p><strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities:</strong></p>
        <p>While the plaque highlights the natural process of childbirth, it also subtly reflects the societal inequities of the time. Women’s roles, though crucial, were largely confined to household duties and childbearing. Moreover, access to medical care during childbirth was likely limited to wealthier women, as suggested by the detailed portrayal of attendants and their resources, which contrasts with the less accessible care for lower-class individuals.</p>

        <p><strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology:</strong></p>
        <p>Childbirth complications, then as now, included a variety of diseases and conditions such as hemorrhaging, puerperal fever, and obstructed labor. The etiology of these conditions ranged from bacterial infections to malnutrition, and often inadequate birth spacing due to social expectations concerning childbearing.</p>

        <p><strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness:</strong></p>
        <p>The relief itself does not visibly depict illness, focusing instead on a successful delivery. However, signs and signifiers present in other artworks of the period might include expressions of pain, postpartum care scenes, or the presence of amulets as protective symbols against birthing misfortune and illness.</p>

        <p><strong>[h] Treatment:</strong></p>
        <p>Roman treatments for childbirth-related illnesses included herbal remedies, dietary adjustments, and midwifery techniques. The presence of attendants in the plaque may suggest the use of skilled midwifery, which included massage, positioning techniques, and in some case, rudimentary surgical interventions to ensure the delivery's success.</p>

        <p><strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness:</strong></p>
        <p>Socio-economic status, family structure, and cultural beliefs heavily influenced the health outcomes of childbirth in ancient Rome. Wealthier women had access to trained midwives and physicians, while poorer women might rely on experienced relatives or basic community support. Nutritional status and access to clean living conditions were also significant factors affecting maternal and infant health.</p>
