        <h1>Henri Gervex Before the Operation: Dr. Pean Teaching His Discovery of Compression of Blood Vessels at Saint Louis Hospital</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Henri Gervex was a French academic painter, often regarded for his mastery in representing contemporary life and historical subjects with nuanced realism. Born in 1852, Gervex's oeuvre includes numerous celebrated works, often highlighting scientific and medical advancements of his time.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The painting “Before the Operation” was created in 1887, a period marked by significant advancements in medicine and surgery. This era, known as the Belle Époque in France, was characterized by industrial progress, burgeoning scientific discoveries, and an increased public interest in science and technology.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The artwork depicts Dr. Pean demonstrating his breakthrough in vascular surgery, surrounded by attentive medical professionals. The solemn atmosphere, captured through meticulous detail, symbolizes the reverence for medical innovation and the communal pursuit of knowledge during this period.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Gervex employs a realistic style, using somber color palettes and intricate detailing to emphasize the gravity and professionalism of the medical environment. The composition draws viewers into the surgical scene, using light effectively to focus on the central figures, thus enhancing the narrative.</p>

        <h2>Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This period was also marked by social stratification; while medical advancements promised new possibilities, access to such care was often limited to the privileged classes. The painting symbolizes both the promise and exclusivity of scientific progress.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The painting does not represent a specific disease but rather illustrates a medical procedure—compression of blood vessels. At the time, this technique was crucial in surgeries to manage bleeding and improve surgical outcomes, reflecting the growing expertise in vascular surgery.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The artwork subtly denotes the critical nature of the procedure through the focused attention of the medical practitioners. The patient’s pallor and vulnerable position suggest a state of reliance on the advancements and skills of the medical team, highlighting the vital role of surgical interventions.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>The painting captures the teaching of hemostatic techniques, specifically compression of blood vessels, which was pioneering in reducing surgical mortality rates and improving patient outcomes in the late 19th century.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The ability to receive such advanced medical care was often contingent upon social status. The setting in a hospital like Saint Louis underscores the divide between those who had access to cutting-edge medical interventions and those who remained marginalized.</p>
