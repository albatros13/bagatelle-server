        <h1>The Flagellants by Pieter van Laer (1635)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        Pieter van Laer, a Dutch Golden Age painter, is known for his genre scenes and landscapes. Born in 1599, Laer developed a distinct style characterized by his portrayal of everyday life and his skill in capturing human emotions.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        The painting "The Flagellants" was completed in 1635, reflecting a period of intense religious fervor in Europe. The 17th century was marked by the Counter-Reformation, which saw various forms of penance and religious displays, such as flagellation, gain prominence.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        The painting illustrates a group of flagellants, representing self-punishment as atonement for sins. The white robes and hoods symbolize purity and anonymity, emphasizing the spiritual over the individual identity.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance</h2>
        Van Laer’s work is characterized by its chiaroscuro effects, where contrasting light and shadow emphasize the figures’ somber mood. The composition draws attention to the communal nature of the act, employing balance and perspective to guide the viewer's eye through the scene.

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        The painting highlights societal divisions, as only certain groups engaged in or could afford such religious acts. It reflects a world where social class influenced one's spiritual practices and the ability to seek penance in such public displays.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        Given the context of the painting, it's not focused on a specific biomedical disease but rather on a spiritual 'ailment' - sin. The perceived necessity for acts like flagellation stemmed from the belief that physical suffering could absolve spiritual maladies.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        The act of flagellation here represents the embodiment of penance and spiritual purging. It's a testament to the period's view of redemption through physical suffering, indicative of the societal understanding of illness as being intertwined with spiritual health.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        The 'treatment' in this context involves the physical act of self-flagellation as a remedy for spiritual malaise, believed to provide divine favor and personal purification.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        The practice depicted underscores how religion, culture, and societal expectations function as determinants of behavior, often classifying moral 'failings' as ailments needing correction through prescribed rituals.
