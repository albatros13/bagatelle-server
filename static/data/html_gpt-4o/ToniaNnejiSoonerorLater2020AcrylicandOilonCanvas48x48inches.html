        <h1>Tonia Nneji's "Sooner or Later"</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Tonia Nneji is a contemporary Nigerian artist known for her compelling visual narratives that reflect personal and communal experiences. Her work often explores themes such as identity, health, and self-discovery, bringing a unique perspective to contemporary art through the lens of her cultural background.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 2020, "Sooner or Later" emerges at a time when the world is grappling with a global pandemic, placing health at the forefront of socio-cultural discourse. The piece reflects both personal and collective experiences, capturing the tension between resilience and vulnerability that characterized this period.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>Nneji's artwork often employs vibrant colors and intricate patterns to symbolize various aspects of the human experience. In "Sooner or Later," the use of textiles and the figures’ postures may represent the merging of traditional and modern life, as well as the intricate tapestry of personal and communal narratives.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Nneji employs a bold color palette and dynamic composition to create a sense of movement and energy. The contrasts between light and dark areas emphasize the emotional depth of the figures, while the use of geometric patterns enhances the visual rhythm, drawing the viewer into the narrative.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The artwork highlights the disparities in healthcare access and representation, particularly within African communities. By focusing on personal health narratives, Nneji draws attention to the systemic inequities that affect marginalized groups, urging a call for empathy and action.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While the artwork itself does not depict a specific disease, it metaphorically addresses the theme of illness, reflecting on both physical and mental health challenges. The broader context of the COVID-19 pandemic during its creation adds layers to its interpretation.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The layered textures and fragmented forms in Nneji's work allude to the complex nature of illness and healing. The intertwined patterns symbolize the internal and external struggles faced by individuals dealing with health issues.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The treatment of illness in this context is both a personal journey and a collective responsibility. Through visual storytelling, Nneji advocates for dialogue and understanding as crucial components of healing and health equity.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>"Sooner or Later" implicitly addresses various social determinants of health, such as economic stability, access to healthcare, and cultural attitudes toward illness. These factors are interwoven within the complex narratives depicted in the artwork.</p>
