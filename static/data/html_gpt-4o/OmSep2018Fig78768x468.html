        <h1>Art and Biomedical Analysis: Leprosy and Smallpox in Historical Artworks</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        The first image, depicting leprosy, is credited to Anglicus B. from 1450. The artwork is titled "Leper with a Clapper" and is housed in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. The second image portrays smallpox, attributed to the artist Suster Mans J., depicting Ferdinando II de' Medici, and dated to 1626, located in the Galleria Palatina, Florence.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        The first image comes from the mid-15th century, a period marked by widespread fear of contagious diseases like leprosy, which was heavily stigmatized in medieval Europe. The second artwork originates from the early 17th century, a time when smallpox was rampant across Europe and caused significant mortality among young and old alike, further inciting a cultural fear of disease.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        In Anglicus B.'s image, the clapper held by the leper symbolizes the isolation mandated by society, as lepers were often required to signal their presence. Suster Mans J.'s depiction of smallpox marks the visible devastation of the illness, with skin lesions serving as a powerful symbol of the disease's ravages on human life.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        The first image employs a detailed and vibrant medieval style, focusing on narrative symbolism. The use of color and perspective illustrates the distant stance of society from the infected. In contrast, the second image uses portraiture and realism to convey empathy and attention to the afflicted, emphasizing human vulnerability.

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        Both images convey the social ostracization faced by individuals afflicted with contagious diseases. In medieval times, lepers faced significant marginalization, while those with smallpox were stigmatized and often isolated from communities, reflecting broader societal inequities in health care and support.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        Leprosy, a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and eyes. Smallpox, caused by the variola virus, is characterized by fever and a distinctive progressive skin rash.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        In the depiction of leprosy, visible signs include skin lesions and deformities, indicative of nerve damage. In the smallpox portrait, dense pustular rash on the skin represents the pustules characteristic of this virus.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        Historically, treatment for leprosy was largely supportive due to the limited medical knowledge of the time, with isolation being the primary method. For smallpox, variolation and later vaccination by Edward Jenner markedly reduced case numbers by the latter part of the 18th century.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Economic status, lack of medical knowledge, and social isolation were significant contributors to the spread and impact of both diseases. Public health infrastructure was poorly developed, affecting treatment and prevention efforts.
