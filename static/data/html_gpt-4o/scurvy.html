        <h1>Scurvy</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork titled "Scurvy" is created by Robert Thom, an illustrator known for his detailed depictions of historical and scientific subjects. Thom's works are often imbued with narrative elements that highlight specific moments in history, particularly those involving medical and scientific advancements.</p>
        
        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        <p>This artwork is set during the Age of Sail, roughly spanning the 16th to the 19th century. This period was characterized by extensive naval exploration, trade, and colonization, primarily driven by European powers. Scurvy was a particularly notorious disease during this era, afflicting sailors who spent extended periods at sea without access to fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>
        
        <h2>Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>In this image, the figures represent sailors and medical practitioners aboard a ship. The presence of the ship's captain, along with bedridden sailors and an attending physician, symbolizes the pervasive threat of scurvy and the emergent understanding of its treatment. The dimly lit ship cabin and the somber expressions convey the desperation and severity of the situation.</p>
        
        <h2>Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Thom employs a realistic style characterized by detailed brushwork and an emphasis on naturalistic representation. The use of warm tones contrasts with the cool shadows, creating a sense of depth and emphasizing the gravity of the scene. The composition guides the viewer’s eye from the interacting figures to the receding background, encapsulating the confined, oppressive atmosphere of a ship's lower deck.</p>
        
        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The occurrence of scurvy among sailors underscores the socio-economic and cultural inequities of the time. Many sailors came from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, rendering them more vulnerable to neglect and inadequate nutrition. The lack of access to essential nutrients was compounded by extended maritime journeys prioritized over the well-being of crew members.</p>
        
        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Scurvy is a disease resulting from a deficiency in vitamin C, crucial for collagen synthesis. As collagen is vital for maintaining connective tissues, its deficiency leads to weakened blood vessels, gums, and skin. Scurvy was common among sailors who lacked access to fresh fruits and vegetables during long voyages.</p>
        
        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Clinical signs of scurvy include swollen, bleeding gums, joint pain, anemia, and skin hemorrhages. The artwork likely illustrates these symptoms through the depiction of frail, bedridden sailors. Their pallor and lethargic postures highlight the debilitating effects of the disease, while the attentive physician represents the growing medical awareness of the period.</p>
        
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>The primary treatment for scurvy involves replenishing vitamin C levels through the consumption of citrus fruits, like lemons and limes, or other foods rich in vitamin C. The widespread understanding of this remedy marked a significant advancement in medical knowledge and sea voyage practices.</p>
        
        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The prevalence of scurvy was exacerbated by economic constraints, limited knowledge of nutrition, and the prioritization of commerce over crew health. It reflects broader socio-cultural attitudes towards maritime labor and the distribution of resources during that era.</p>
