        <h1>Statue Showing a Woman with a Goiter Growth</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artist of this intriguing statue remains unknown, reflecting a common occurrence in 19th-century tribal art. This piece likely originates from an African or Indigenous community where artistry was often a communal rather than individual pursuit.</p>

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The 19th-century context hints at a time when European colonization was expanding, bringing about significant social and cultural disruptions. Art from this period often embodies resistance to these changes and a clinging to traditional forms and functions.</p>

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The figure’s pronounced goiter may symbolize the socio-cultural significance of the thyroid disease in the community. It might reflect a specific health crisis or draw attention to the beauty and strength of the human form despite ailments.</p>

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/principles of design)</h2>
        <p>This statue employs a distinctive exaggeration found in much tribal art, emphasizing the goiter to draw focus. The proportion and texture lend the piece a unique aesthetic, reflecting an understanding of balance and contrast.</p>

        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Such artworks often embody the stories of marginalized voices, highlighting the disparities in healthcare access between different social groups. The goiter could have been a common affliction in the artist's community due to dietary insufficiencies.</p>

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Goiter is an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland, often due to iodine deficiency. In the 19th century, knowledge about dietary causes was limited, making such conditions more prevalent in certain regions.</p>

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The swelling in the neck area is the most visible sign, often accompanied by symptoms like difficulty breathing or swallowing. This statue captures these aspects through its detailed representation.</p>

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the 19th century, goiter treatment was primarily surgical or through dietary changes once iodine's importance was understood. In many tribal contexts, traditional remedies and rituals might have also played a role.</p>

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors contributing to goiter prevalence included limited access to nutritious food, particularly iodine-rich sources, which was more common in inland regions. Socioeconomic status heavily influenced diet and health outcomes.</p>
