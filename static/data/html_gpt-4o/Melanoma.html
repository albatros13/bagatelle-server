        <h2>Melanoma: Art and Biomedical Analysis</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>This artwork is by Francisco Goya, a prominent Spanish artist known for his profound impact on the trajectory of Western art. Goya, often called the last of the Old Masters and the first of the modern ones, is celebrated for his powerful, dark, and direct representation of both reality and imagination.</p>
        
        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>Created in 1800, "Charles IV of Spain and His Family" captures an era marked by the socio-political upheavals following the Age of Enlightenment. During this period, Goya served as a court painter under Charles IV and witnessed the waning power of the Spanish monarchy amid burgeoning revolutionary sentiments in Europe.</p>
        
        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The painting is infused with symbolism reflective of the Spanish court's opulence yet hints at underlying tensions. Goya's subtle play with expressions and positioning suggests critical commentary on the royalty's obliviousness and vulnerabilities. Fashioned with imperial regalia, the figures are simultaneously elevated and dissected for their guileless demeanor.</p>
        
        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>This piece embodies Goya's distinctive style, which melds realism with a profound psychological depth. The use of chiaroscuro enhances the three-dimensionality and presence of the figures, while the composition guides the viewer's eye through a visually orchestrated hierarchy, reflecting social hierarchies.</p>
        
        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Goya's painting subtly critiques court life, juxtaposing royal grandeur with hints of superficiality and decay. The opulence depicted starkly contrasts the reality of widespread poverty and inequality prevalent in early 19th-century Spain, highlighting social inequities of power and wealth.</p>
        
        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that begins in the melanocytes, the cells responsible for pigment production. It’s primarily caused by DNA damage from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sun exposure or tanning beds, leading to the transformation of normal melanocytes into malignant ones.</p>
        
        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Key signs of melanoma include changes in a mole's size, shape, or color. The ABCDE rule—Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter over 6mm, and Evolution—is often used for early detection. The presence of these characteristics warrants medical evaluation.</p>
        
        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment of melanoma depends on the stage of the cancer. Options may include surgical removal, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation. Early-stage melanomas can often be cured with surgery alone, while advanced melanoma may require more complex treatment combinations.</p>
        
        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Social and environmental determinants, such as access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, and education, play pivotal roles in melanoma outcomes. Preventative measures, like awareness and protective behaviors against UV exposure, are influenced by these determinants, impacting incidence and mortality rates.</p>
