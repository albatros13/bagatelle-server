        <h1>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis of an Ancient Greek Tombstone</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        The marble tombstone is attributed to an unknown sculptor who was active in the Roman Imperial period of Greek history. The work reflects the skill and precision of ancient artisans who were adept at portraying human forms and narratives in stone.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        This artwork originates from the 2nd century CE, a period when Greece was under Roman rule, known as the Greco-Roman era. This time was marked by the blending of Greek and Roman cultures, leading to advancements in arts, sciences, and medicine. Physicians like the depicted Jason were influenced by both Hippocratic traditions and Roman medical practices.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        The tombstone’s relief shows Jason examining a child, likely symbolizing the role of the physician as a caregiver and healer. Such depictions were emblematic of the medical profession and conveyed the societal respect and importance of physicians. The enlarged abdomen of the child could signify a disease or condition recognized and treated by the physician.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        The tombstone exemplifies classical Greek art's focus on realism and human anatomy. The figures are rendered with attention to proportion and posture, creating a lifelike interaction between the physician and the child. The narrative relief style helps convey a story, emphasizing the role of doctors in ancient society.

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        During this era, access to medical care was not equitable; it was largely reserved for the wealthy or those of high status. Physicians like Jason were likely part of a learned elite, with their skills being accessible mainly to those who could afford their services. This public display through the tombstone underscores the prestige associated with the profession.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        The sculptural representation of an enlarged abdomen in the child may indicate conditions such as ascites or other abdominal distensions commonly understood in ancient medical practices. Conditions causing such symptoms were often linked to liver disease, malnutrition, or other systemic illnesses.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        The artwork subtly uses visual diagnosis—a swollen abdomen—as a signifier of illness. This kind of representation underscores the physician’s diagnostic role in identifying physical symptoms indicative of underlying health issues, a practice still relevant in modern medicine.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        While treatments varied, records suggest a combination of dietary regulation, herbal remedies, and surgical interventions might have been used for conditions causing abdominal distension. Physicians such as Jason might have employed techniques rooted in both empirical observations and the theoretical medical frameworks of the time.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        During the Roman Imperial period, factors such as social class, occupation, and urban living conditions significantly impacted health outcomes. Poor living conditions and limited access to food and clean water often contributed to the prevalence of diseases like those causing abdominal distension.
