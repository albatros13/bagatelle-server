        <h1>Ginsle A Surgeon in his Workroom Extracting Stones from a Man's Head (1806)</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This artwork is attributed to [Unknown Artist]. It is a piece that reflects the European fascination with medical practices during the 19th century.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 1806, this painting falls within a period rich with advancements and public interest in scientific exploration and medicine. The early 19th century was characterized by significant scientific developments, yet many medical practices were still rudimentary and often questioned.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting vividly depicts a medical practitioner removing 'stones' from a man's head, a metaphorical representation of cures for ailments like headaches or mental disorders. Historically, the depiction of extracting stones from the head was an allegorical portrayal of curing madness or folly.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork utilizes chiaroscuro to create a dramatic atmosphere, emphasizing the facial expressions and capturing the intensity and gravity of the practice being undertaken. The use of shadow and light highlights the meticulous setting of a surgeon’s workroom.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting reflects a time where medical practices were often performed without consent, especially on those of lower social standings. This highlights the social inequities of accessing medical treatments and the often exploitative nature of medical practices on the poor or uneducated.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>This piece reflects the historical misunderstanding of mental illness and neurological disorders, which were thought to be caused by physical abnormalities, like stones in the head. It illustrates misattributed ailments to a tangible cause, rather than understanding psychological or neurological roots.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The presence of 'stones' indicates a tangible manifestation of illness, reflecting the archaic practice of trepanation. While not grounded in modern medical understanding, it signifies an early attempt at surgical intervention in mental health.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The portrayed treatment involves physical extraction, which align with early surgical practices aimed more at relieving symptoms rather than curing root causes. Such procedures were precursors to more scientific approaches in later years.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The artwork underscores how poverty, lack of access to proper medical care, and social status impacted the health outcomes of individuals. It reflects the period's limitations in medical understanding and often detrimental treatments imposed on the socially disadvantaged.</p>
