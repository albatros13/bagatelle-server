        <h2>Rashidad Din's Jami' al-tawarikh: Birth of a Prince - The Astrologers Have Astrolabes</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork titled "Birth of a Prince" is part of the Jami' al-tawarikh, a comprehensive world history chronicled by Rashid al-Din in the 14th century. Rashid al-Din was a Persian physician, historian, and statesman who served in the royal court of the Ilkhanate. The Ilkhanate was a division of the Mongol Empire, situated in modern-day Iran. The artworks associated with Jami' al-tawarikh exhibit the collaboration of diverse influences, reflecting the fusion of Persian, Islamic, and Mongol artistic traditions.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>This particular illustration hails from the early 14th century, a period marked by the Mongol Empire's influence over Persia. Under Mongol rule, there was a cultural renaissance that welcomed diverse artistic and intellectual contributions from various regions. The Jami' al-tawarikh chronicles events from the perspective of this multicultural understanding. The birth of a prince is a celebration captured within the societal elite, depicting not only a joyous occasion but also an assertion of lineage and authority in Mongol and Persian culture.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The depiction of astrologers holding astrolabes signifies the importance of celestial divination and prophecy in royal births and governance during this era. The astrolabe, a sophisticated instrument of the period, represents science, wisdom, and the guidance of celestial powers. The image of the newborn prince swaddled symbolizes purity, new beginnings, and continuity of the dynasty, essential themes within the Mongol-ruled Persian society.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/ Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>The illustration features characteristic elements of Persian miniature painting, with intricate details and bright colors that convey a lively, animated scene. The use of diagonal lines in the textiles suggests movement and energy, while the composition balances celebration with solemnity. The figures are outlined clearly with precise handling of line and form, providing a narrative depth to the piece.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The scene is reflective of the hierarchical structures present during the time, where scholars and astrologers served the elite. The presence of astrologers indicates a reliance on inherited and institutionalized knowledge under the guise of divine right, illustrating a societal divide between the ruling classes and common folk, where the privilege of birth associated with royalty was celebrated prominently.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>While the illustration does not directly depict biomedical themes, an extrapolation might identify certain figures potentially exhibiting signs of aging or illness, reflective of medieval understandings of health, where natural explanations intermingled with medicinal practices grounded in astrology and ancient texts.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The figures demonstrate signs of the period's understanding of health through their postures, gestures, and appearances. The lack of advanced medical knowledge often led to attributing physical conditions or ailments to celestial or mystical influences observed through their postures and expressions.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment of illnesses during this time often involved a combination of herbal remedies and spiritual/astrological elements, as illustrated by the presence of astrologers—figures who symbolized the interweaving of medicine and astrology.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Social determinants of health in this period were heavily influenced by class and status. Within such artworks, one can infer that royal birth overshadowed common life, where access to resources, knowledge, and treatments were reserved for the elite, highlighting inequities of health and welfare.</p>
