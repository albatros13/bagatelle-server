        <h1>Caravaggio - The Seven Acts of Mercy</h1>
        
        <h2>a. Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The painting "The Seven Acts of Mercy" was created by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, an influential Italian Baroque painter. Caravaggio was renowned for his dramatic use of lighting and his intense realism, both of which contributed to the spread of the Baroque style across Europe in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.</p>
        
        <h2>b. Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created around 1607, this artwork was produced during the Counter-Reformation, a period marked by the Catholic Church's efforts to reclaim its influence amid the challenge posed by Protestant Reformation. Art was used strategically during this time to communicate religious themes and promote Catholic values.</p>
        
        <h2>c. Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>"The Seven Acts of Mercy" depicts acts of compassion such as feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, and visiting the imprisoned. The artwork embodies Christian moral virtues through these corporal works of mercy as described in the Gospel of Matthew. Each act is represented through figures engaging in these deeds, symbolizing communal and divine benevolence.</p>
        
        <h2>d. Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>Caravaggio is noted for his mastery of chiaroscuro, a technique that utilizes stark contrasts between light and dark to achieve a sense of three-dimensionality. This painting exemplifies Caravaggio's stylistic approach through dramatic lighting and the realistic depiction of human figures, which adds emotional depth and enhances narrative clarity.</p>
        
        <h2>e. Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>During the time of Caravaggio, societal inequities such as poverty and social injustice were prevalent. This piece visually articulates a Christian response to these issues, emphasizing aid and compassion towards those marginalized and impoverished, urging viewers to reflect on their societal positions and moral responsibilities.</p>
        
        <h2>f. Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Caravaggio’s era was also marked by various plagues and diseases, which often found subtle depiction in artworks. Although "The Seven Acts of Mercy" primarily addresses acts of kindness, the underlying context of disease provides a backdrop against which mercy becomes a necessity.</p>
        
        <h2>g. Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In depicting the needy, Caravaggio’s work mirrors the physical vulnerabilities of his time. Figures displaying signs of famine, weakness, and desperation can symbolize the widespread impact of disease and malnutrition in 17th-century Europe.</p>
        
        <h2>h. Treatment</h2>
        <p>The acts of mercy themselves can be interpreted as metaphorical treatments of societal and physical ailments. These actions symbolize a collective effort to alleviate suffering and offer humanitarian relief through personal and communal interventions.</p>
        
        <h2>i. Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The socioeconomic and political conditions of the era significantly influenced public health. Limited access to care, poor living conditions, and widespread poverty were major determinants of disease prevalence, influencing how artists like Caravaggio depicted suffering and human dignity.</p>
