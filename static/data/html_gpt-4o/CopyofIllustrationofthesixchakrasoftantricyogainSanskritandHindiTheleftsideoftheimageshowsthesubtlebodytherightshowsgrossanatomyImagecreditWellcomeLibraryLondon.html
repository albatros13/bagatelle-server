        <h1>The Six Chakras of Tantric Yoga</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The artwork depicting the six chakras of tantric yoga does not have a specific known artist, instead representing a collective work rooted in ancient Indian spiritual practice and tantric traditions. Tantra, as a spiritual and esoteric practice, emerged within specific Indian cultural contexts, often attributed to Hindu and Buddhist lineages.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The illustration of the chakras aligns with a long-standing Hindu and Buddhist tradition, originating as early as the 2nd century BCE. The artwork stands as part of a broader sociocultural practice that saw further elaboration during the medieval period of Indian history. It reflects a period where spirituality, physical health, and metaphysical introspection were deeply interwoven.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h2>
        <p>The chakras symbolically represent centers of energy within the human body, key in both tantric and yogic practices. Each chakra, illustrated uniquely, carries specific spiritual significance—from the root chakra (Muladhara) at the base of the spine to the crown chakra (Sahasrara) at the top of the head—signifying various psychological and spiritual states.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>The artwork utilizes symbolic drawings to differentiate between the subtle and gross body structures. The left part shows chakras which are portrayed with distinct colors and symbols, adhering to principles of balance and symmetry. The use of Sanskrit and Hindi emphasizes the traditional origins, while the gross anatomy on the right complements the subtle body with detailed human anatomy.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The practice of tantra and yoga historically faced critiques and restrictions in various societal contexts, often being confined to certain caste or gender lines. This artwork underscores cultural disparities where such spiritual knowledge was once accessible only to specific social groups deemed pure or educated enough to handle esoteric practices.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The chakra system is traditionally linked to holistic health, with imbalances in specific chakras believed to correspond to both physical and psychological ailments. For instance, an imbalance in the solar plexus chakra (Manipura) is considered to affect self-esteem and digestion, affecting the physical and emotional body.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Chakric imbalances manifest through various signs such as fatigue, stress, or chronic ailments. The tantric system interprets these as energy blockages within specific chakras, visible through symptoms correlating to the bodily regions governed by said chakras. For instance, throat chakra (Vishuddha) issues relate to communication problems and thyroid disorders.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatments within the tantric framework include meditation, yoga postures aimed at the affected chakras, mantras, and mudras. These are combined with holistic approaches like dietary changes and lifestyle adjustments, emphasizing a balance between physical, mental, and spiritual health.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Illness within the chakra paradigm can be influenced by various social determinants, including stress from societal roles, lifestyle factors dictated by cultural norms, or socioeconomic conditions limiting access to holistic practices or balanced nutrition.</p>
