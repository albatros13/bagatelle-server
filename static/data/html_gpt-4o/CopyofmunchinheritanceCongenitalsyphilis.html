        <h1>An Analysis of Edvard Munch's 'Inheritance'</h1>

        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe</h2>
        <p>Edvard Munch, a Norwegian painter and printmaker, created the artwork titled "Inheritance." He is an artist known for his expressionistic style and exploring psychological themes in his work.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h2>
        <p>The artwork was created during the late 19th century, a period marked by significant political and social change in Europe. The painting reflects the cultural anxieties surrounding health, morality, and heredity prevalent during this era.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>Munch employs stark symbolism through the depiction of an infant suffering from congenital syphilis. The image underscores themes of innocence and corruption, highlighting the tragic consequences of inherited diseases.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        <p>The painting uses muted color palettes and dramatic contrasts to evoke emotional responses. Munch’s characteristic brushwork conveys a sense of distress and fragility that aligns with the painting's somber subject matter.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The work reflects the social inequities of the time, particularly related to the stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and the socio-economic factors contributing to their spread.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Congenital syphilis is an infection passed from mother to child during pregnancy. It arises from the bacterium Treponema pallidum, leading to severe developmental issues and often tragic outcomes if untreated.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The infant in the painting exhibits signs characteristic of congenital syphilis, such as skin rashes and a frail appearance. These visual cues are potent representations of the illness's impact on vulnerable populations.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>During the late 19th century, treatment options were limited and often ineffective. Modern medicine has since developed antibiotics, like penicillin, that effectively treat congenital syphilis if administered timely.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Factors such as poverty, lack of education, and inadequate healthcare access have historically exacerbated the prevalence and impact of congenital syphilis. These determinants continue to influence disease spread today.</p>
