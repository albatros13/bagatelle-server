        <h2>Art Historical and Biomedical Analysis</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The manuscript "La Queste del Saint Graal," from which this illustration is taken, is a part of the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, an anonymous French medieval text. The manuscript was created in Northern France and is associated with the prolific artistic output of gothic Christian Europe. The artists are unknown, as is typical with works from this period.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>This artwork dates to the early 14th century, around 1316. This period in Europe was marked by a strong religious influence, with Christianity dominating social and cultural life. The legend of the Holy Grail was particularly popular during this time, serving as both a spiritual allegory and a source of chivalric inspiration.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/ or iconography</h3>
        <p>The image depicts knights carrying the Holy Grail to Sarras, a city often portrayed as the final resting place for the Grail in Arthurian legends. The Grail is emblematic of divine grace and spiritual enlightenment. The presence of crosses on the knights' armors underscores the religious context and the role of chivalry intertwined with faith.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>The illustration employs a flat perspective typical of medieval art. The use of vivid colors and detailed patterns reflects the manuscript's aim to capture viewers' imaginations and convey the narrative effectively. The stylized portrayal of figures and their attire also reveals insights into the medieval artist's techniques and visual priorities.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The Grail legends inherently reflect societal hierarchies of the time. Access to such religious manuscripts was limited to the elite, and the narratives often highlighted the privileged classes, such as knights and royalty, reinforcing the existing social orders.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>In the context of medieval art, the representation of physical ailments serves to highlight moral or spiritual failings. In this image, one of the figures appears lame, which might be a metaphor for moral or spiritual imperfection—common in allegorical medieval art.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The medieval depiction does not show an accurate medical understanding, yet it symbolizes the broader concept of human frailty and imperfection as seen through the lens of religious morality. The crutch and posture signify disability, used symbolically rather than as a precise medical study.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>During this time, treatments were rudimentary and steeped in superstition or religious practice. Belief in divine intervention was common, and physical ailments might be seen as requiring spiritual healing or penance more than medical treatment.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The artwork indirectly reflects how religion and class could dictate one's access to care. Wealth and social status often determined the quality of medical attention or spiritual guidance one could receive, and religious beliefs heavily influenced the perceived understanding of disability and illness.</p>
