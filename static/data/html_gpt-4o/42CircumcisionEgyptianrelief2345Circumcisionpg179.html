        <h2>Circumcision Egyptian Relief</h2>
        
        <h3>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The artwork titled "Circumcision Egyptian Relief" is an ancient Egyptian artifact. The precise artist remains unidentified, as is common with many ancient Egyptian artworks. This relief is attributed to the broader cultural and artistic practices of ancient Egypt, specifically reflecting religious and ceremonial aspects of Egyptian society.</p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h3>
        <p>This relief dates back to ancient Egypt, a civilization that thrived from around 3100 BCE to 30 BCE. The practice of circumcision in ancient Egypt is believed to have been a rite of passage and religiously significant, reflecting the societal norms and beliefs of the time. The historical context of this period was marked by a strong emphasis on religion, with a pantheon of gods influencing daily life and cultural practices.</p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>In the context of Egyptian iconography, circumcision might symbolize purification or a rite of passage, aligning the individual more closely with societal and religious norms. The relief may have depicted this act to portray the individual's transition into a new phase of life or as part of acceptance into a particular religious order or status group.</p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h3>
        <p>The relief utilizes bas-relief, a technique where figures are carved into a flat surface to create a shallow depth. Egyptian art is characterized by its use of frontal profiles, hieratic scale, and symbolic gestures. The figures in this relief likely exemplify these characteristics, focusing on clarity and narrative over realistic representation.</p>

        <h3>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The practice of circumcision in ancient Egyptian society may reflect broader social hierarchies and inequities. Access to certain rites and their associated status might have been restricted to specific classes or groups within the society. The relief might tacitly imply these social divisions, where such a ritual was a marker of higher social or religious standing.</p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>In biomedical terms, circumcision itself is not a disease but a surgical procedure that involves the removal of the foreskin from the penis. Historically, it has been associated with both religious practices and health benefits, including reduced risk of certain infections.</p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Signs of illness related to circumcision historically might involve infections or complications from the procedure if not performed with sterile techniques or adequate medical knowledge, which would not have been available in ancient times.</p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>Treatment during ancient times for post-operative care likely involved basic herbal remedies and poultices to address any complications such as infection or excessive bleeding. There is scant evidence about the exact medical practices of ancient Egypt, but some records suggest the use of honey for its antibacterial properties.</p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Social determinants greatly affect health outcomes in any society, including that of ancient Egypt. Access to proper medical care and follow-up would have been influenced by one's social status and geographic location, potentially affecting the outcomes of circumcision procedures.</p>
