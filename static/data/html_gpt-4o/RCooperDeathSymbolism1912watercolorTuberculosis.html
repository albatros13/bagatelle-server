        <h2>Death Symbolism Tuberculosis (1912)</h2>
        
        <h3>a) Artist/Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>The painting "Death Symbolism Tuberculosis" was created by the artist R. Cooper in 1912. Cooper's works are often noted for their symbolic imagery and exploration of societal issues through art. His style incorporates elements that engage with both personal and communal narratives, often with a focus on health-related themes.</p>
        
        <h3>b) Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>The early 20th century was a period marked by rapid industrialization and urbanization, which contributed to public health challenges. Tuberculosis, a leading cause of death during this time, was emblematic of the struggles against infectious diseases. The socio-economic dynamics of the era saw an intersection of class disparity with access to healthcare, making art like Cooper’s a significant cultural critique.</p>
        
        <h3>c) Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>The painting utilizes a poignant figure of Death, represented in spectral form, symbolizing the looming threat of tuberculosis. The bedridden woman, surrounded by autumn leaves, suggests themes of decay and the fleeting nature of life. The hourglass held by Death indicates the running out of time, highlighting mortality and the inexorability of illness.</p>
        
        <h3>d) Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>Cooper's use of watercolor provides a translucent quality that enhances the ethereal presence of the grim reaper. The balance between the somber figure of Death and the tranquil landscape in the background creates a juxtaposition that accentuates the tension between life and death. Cooper's composition guides the viewer’s eye through layers of meaning encoded within the setting.</p>
        
        <h3>e) Social/Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>Cooper’s illustration reflects the disparities in healthcare access, as tuberculosis was disproportionately prevalent among the lower socio-economic classes. The figure of the woman can be seen as representing those who suffered most from societal inequities related to wealth, healthcare accessibility, and living conditions.</p>
        
        <h3>f) Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs but can spread to other organs. The disease spreads through airborne respiratory droplets, making it highly contagious, especially in crowded urban settings prevalent during the industrial era.</p>
        
        <h3>g) Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Symptoms of tuberculosis, as reflected in the painting, include chronic cough, weight loss, and fatigue—often depicted by the emaciated and pale figure. Cooper’s representation of illness through visual art provides a historical lens on the physical and emotional toll of the disease.</p>
        
        <h3>h) Treatment</h3>
        <p>At the time depicted in the painting, treatments for tuberculosis were limited. Patients often relied on rest, fresh air, and nutritional support—often insufficient—as effective antibiotics would not be discovered until the 1940s. Sanatoriums were common but often inaccessible for the impoverished.</p>
        
        <h3>i) Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The proliferation of tuberculosis was heavily influenced by factors such as poverty, crowded living conditions, and malnutrition. Economic hardship and lack of education exacerbated the spread of the disease, as highlighted by Cooper’s narrative. The painting becomes a social document reflecting these underlying determinants.</p>
