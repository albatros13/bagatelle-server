        <h1>Joseph Merrick and Proteus Syndrome</h1>
        
        <h2>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        The image in question is a historical representation of Joseph Merrick, often referred to as the "Elephant Man." While Merrick was not an artist in the traditional sense, his story has been artistically documented through various forms, including illustrations like the one depicted here. The drawing is an important piece of medical history and highlights the intricacies of documenting rare medical conditions.

        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-Frame)</h2>
        Joseph Merrick lived during the Victorian era in England, specifically during the late 19th century. This period was characterized by a fascination with medical anomalies and the burgeoning field of pathology. The socio-cultural context of the time often relegated individuals with physical deformities to the fringes of society, where they were sometimes displayed in "freak shows" for public curiosity.

        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        The image of Joseph Merrick has become a symbol of both human curiosity and compassion. It represents the broader theme of humanity's struggle to understand and accept differences. The depiction itself serves as an icon of medical enlightenment while also highlighting the ethical dilemmas posed by the display of physical deformities.

        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h2>
        The artistic depiction focuses on realism, capturing the detailed texture and form of Merrick's condition. The stark, monochrome palette emphasizes the contrast between Merrick's unique features and a typical human anatomy. This realism aims to present an unflinching view of Proteus syndrome, compelling viewers to confront the realities faced by individuals with rare medical conditions.

        <h2>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        Joseph Merrick's life story underscores significant social and cultural inequities. Individuals like Merrick were often ostracized and faced systemic discrimination. The era's lack of medical knowledge and societal compassion led to their exploitation. This drawing, in documenting Merrick's condition, serves as a historical record of these inequities.

        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        Proteus syndrome, the condition attributed to Joseph Merrick, is a rare genetic disorder that causes overgrowth of skin, bones, and other tissues. It is caused by mutations in the AKT1 gene, which affect cell growth and development. This mosaic disorder means that different parts of the body exhibit varying characteristics.

        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        The primary pathological signs of Proteus syndrome include asymmetric overgrowth, skin lesions, and vascular malformations. In Merrick's case, these are evident in the irregular growth patterns in the soft tissues and skin depicted in the artwork. This condition can lead to various complications like scoliosis, limb disparities, and other physical deformities.

        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        During Merrick's lifetime, treatment options were limited and largely ineffective. Presently, treatment of Proteus syndrome focuses on managing symptoms and complications. Surgical interventions can address some physical deformities, while supportive therapies aim to improve quality of life.

        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        Social determinants significantly influenced Merrick’s life and well-being. Poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and societal stigma exacerbated his condition. Such factors highlight the critical need for comprehensive social support for individuals with rare disorders, which was notably absent during Merrick's lifetime.
