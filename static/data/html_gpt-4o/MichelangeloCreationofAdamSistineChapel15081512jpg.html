        <h1>Michelangelo - Creation of Adam</h1>
        <h2>[a] Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The "Creation of Adam" is a renowned fresco created by the Italian artist Michelangelo Buonarroti. Michelangelo is often celebrated as one of the greatest artists of the Italian Renaissance. His mastery of sculpture, painting, and architectural design solidified his reputation as a polymath of his time, and his work on the Sistine Chapel ceiling is considered a crowning achievement in Western art.</p>
        
        <h2>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Painted between 1508 and 1512, the "Creation of Adam" is part of the Sistine Chapel ceiling in Vatican City. This period was marked by a renewed interest in the classical civilizations of Greece and Rome, which informed the humanistic ideals of the Renaissance. The Catholic Church held significant influence, and art served as a powerful means of communicating religious themes and narratives.</p>
        
        <h2>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The fresco depicts the biblical creation narrative from the Book of Genesis, where God gives life to Adam, the first man. Michelangelo portrayed this divine act with God reaching out to Adam, symbolizing life and consciousness. Their nearly touching hands have become iconic, symbolizing the close connection between humanity and the divine.</p>
        
        <h2>[d] Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo’s use of dynamic composition and anatomical accuracy captures the vitality and beauty of the human form. The figures of God and Adam are poised in a diagonal line, enhancing the fresco's visual tension. The use of chiaroscuro emphasizes the three-dimensionality of the figures, adding depth to the fresco.</p>
        
        <h2>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>While the Renaissance celebrated human potential and intellect, these ideals were limited in scope. Women's contributions were often overlooked, and certain groups were marginalized. Michelangelo’s works predominantly focus on male figures, reflecting the gender biases of the period.</p>
        
        <h2>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>In viewing the "Creation of Adam," some medical scholars have theorized that the shape of God’s cloak resembles a human brain, linking Michelangelo’s understanding of human anatomy with the fresco’s iconography. Though there is no specific disease depicted, this anatomical detail highlights the intersection of art and early science.</p>
        
        <h2>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>No explicit signs or indicators of illness are present in the fresco. However, the lifelessness in Adam's form could be viewed metaphorically as highlighting the state of humanity before divine intervention.</p>
        
        <h2>[h] Treatment</h2>
        <p>The fresco does not directly address medical treatment. Symbolically, the "treatment" is the breath of life from God, suggesting that spiritual salvation and divine grace are forms of healing and empowerment.</p>
        
        <h2>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The Renaissance period, with its limited medical knowledge and religious underpinnings, often linked illness with spiritual or moral failings. Wealth and status impacted access to healthcare and healthy living conditions, shaping societal perspectives on health and disease.</p>
