        <h2>Marseille Outbreak of Pandemic (1720)</h2>

        <h3>[a] Artist/Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>
            The artwork titled "Marseille Outbreak of Pandemic (1720)" is attributed to an anonymous artist associated with 18th-century European painting. The emphasis may have been more on capturing a historical event than on celebrating a particular artist's style.
        </p>

        <h3>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (Time-frame)</h3>
        <p>
            In 1720, a devastating outbreak occurred in Marseille, France, known as the Great Plague of Marseille. As one of the last significant European outbreaks of bubonic plague, it marked a critical moment in both medical history and European societal development. Originating from a ship that docked despite quarantine measures, the plague decimated the population, claiming around 100,000 lives.
        </p>

        <h3>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography</h3>
        <p>
            This painting is laden with somber symbolism, portraying vast human suffering. The dark tones and chaotic arrangement of bodies suggest despair and mortality. Elements like deserted streets and distant churches illustrate both the desolation of the city and the lingering hope or divine intervention sought by the populace.
        </p>

        <h3>[d] Stylistic Significance (Elements of Art/Principles of Design)</h3>
        <p>
            The painting employs a dramatic use of chiaroscuro, juxtaposing light and dark to highlight both the decay and the dignity of human life. The composition's depth, accentuated by linear perspectives toward the church, draws the viewer's attention from individual suffering to a universal context. The rich texture and muted palette convey the gravity of the situation effectively.
        </p>

        <h3>[e] Social/Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>
            The plague exacerbated existing social inequities: the poor were disproportionately affected due to cramped living conditions and inadequate healthcare. This painting captures these inequities visually, depicting the marginalized groups as collapsed and neglected figures, while individuals of higher status are shown in motion, attempting to manage the crisis.
        </p>

        <h3>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>
            The disease portrayed is the bubonic plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. It was historically spread through fleas carried by rats. The 1720 outbreak highlighted how maritime trade could inadvertently become a vector for disease, given insufficient quarantine protocols.
        </p>

        <h3>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>
            Characters in the painting exhibit the cardinal signs of the plague, including buboes — swollen lymph nodes visible as dark swellings on their bodies. The artwork chillingly captures the rapid, lethal progression of the disease through the prevailing depiction of death and despair.
        </p>

        <h3>[h] Treatment</h3>
        <p>
            During the 1720 outbreak, understanding of the plague was limited, and treatment was rudimentary. Methods included bloodletting, the use of herbal remedies, and quarantine. While these approaches were largely ineffective, they laid a foundational understanding of disease management.
        </p>

        <h3>[i] Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>
            Social determinants such as poverty, lack of knowledge, and inadequate public health infrastructure contributed to the spread of the plague in Marseille. The rapid influx of trade goods exacerbated these conditions, creating a perfect storm for such a health disaster.
