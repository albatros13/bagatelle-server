    <h2>Surgical Tools from Pompeii</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>[a] Artist/ Group/ Tribe:</strong>
        The surgical instruments depicted in the image belong to the ancient Romans, a civilization known for its advancement in medicine and surgical practices. These tools were likely used by Roman surgeons known as 'medici,' who were vital in both civilian and military contexts. The tools were uncovered in Pompeii, a city famously preserved under volcanic ash after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>[b] Historical and Socio-Cultural Context:</strong>
        The Roman Empire, at its peak, was a society that valued knowledge and skill, particularly in medicine. Roman medical practices were influenced by earlier Greek medical theories. The tools from Pompeii date back to the first century AD, a time of significant urban growth and prosperity in the empire, before its eventual decline. This period was marked by both technological advancements and a rich cultural life, including public health initiatives such as aqueducts and public bathing facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>[c] Symbolism and/or Iconography:</strong>
        The instruments symbolize the Romans’ pragmatic approach to health and wellness, reflecting a legacy of innovation and mastery in surgical techniques. Each tool served a specific medical purpose, indicating the specialized nature of Roman surgical procedures, from limb amputations to dental surgeries. The presence of such tools suggests a well-organized approach to healthcare in Roman society.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>[d] Stylistic Significance:</strong>
        The design of these tools exhibits a blend of functionality and craftsmanship. They were made from iron and bronze, indicating durability. The tools reflect Roman engineering prowess, highlighting elements of design such as ergonomics and precision. Tools were often multi-functional, a testimony to the efficiency valued by Roman society.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>[e] Social / Cultural Inequities:</strong>
        In ancient Rome, access to advanced medical care and trained physicians was often restricted to the wealthy and influential. The tools demonstrate the disparity in healthcare services, with the poor often relying on less qualified healers or traditional remedies. Despite this inequality, the presence of sophisticated medical tools suggests a prioritization of healthcare innovation among the elite.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>[f] Description of Disease & Etiology:</strong>
        Roman medical texts reveal a range of ailments treated using these tools, from bone fractures to infections. Treatment was often based on balancing the bodily humors. Surgical procedures were common, especially in military settings where traumatic injuries required swift intervention. Hygiene was a significant concern, although germ theory was not yet understood.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>[g] Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness:</strong>
        Common signs of illness treated by these tools included inflammation, swelling, and visible injuries. Roman surgeons relied on physical examination and symptoms to diagnose diseases, indicating a rudimentary yet practical understanding of pathology.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>[h] Treatment:</strong>
        Treatments ranged from surgical intervention to the use of herbs and ointments. The tools reflect an understanding of various surgical techniques such as cauterization, incision, and extraction. Roman medical practice emphasized both surgical and nonsurgical methods, supported by comprehensive medical texts from physicians like Galen.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>[i] Social Determinants of Illness:</strong>
        Factors like socio-economic status, living conditions, and occupational hazards greatly influenced health in Roman society. Poor hygiene and crowded living conditions contributed to the spread of disease. The privileged had access to better nutrition and healthcare, underscoring the role of social conditions in health outcomes.
