        <h1>Bloodletting Points and Moxa Points on the Human Body</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This medical illustration represents the anonymous tradition of Tibetan medical artists who created detailed anatomical charts for the Four Medical Tantras (rGyud bzhi). These artists worked within monastic institutions and medical colleges, combining artistic skill with profound medical knowledge. The work exemplifies the collaborative nature of Tibetan medical manuscript production, where physician-scholars worked alongside skilled painters to create precise therapeutic guides.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>This illustration likely dates to the 17th-19th centuries, during the height of Tibetan medical manuscript production. The artwork emerged from the Tibetan medical tradition established by Yuthok Yonten Gonpo in the 8th century, which synthesized Indian Ayurveda, Chinese medicine, and indigenous Bon healing practices. During this period, medical knowledge was primarily preserved and transmitted through monastic institutions, making these visual texts crucial educational tools for training physicians in the complex art of bloodletting and moxibustion.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The figure displays the characteristic iconography of Tibetan medical illustrations, with the body presented frontally with arms raised to maximize anatomical visibility. The colored dots represent specific therapeutic points: red circles typically indicate bloodletting points (gtar sa), while other colored markers denote moxibustion points (me btsa'). The Tibetan script labels each point with precise anatomical terminology. The figure's serene expression and formal pose reflect the sacred nature of medical knowledge in Tibetan culture, while the geometric arrangement of points demonstrates the systematic approach to therapeutic intervention.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The artwork employs the flat, two-dimensional style characteristic of Tibetan medical illustration, prioritizing clarity and precision over naturalistic representation. The use of earth tones—ochre, red, and muted green—reflects traditional Tibetan pigments and creates visual hierarchy. The symmetrical composition and frontal presentation follow established conventions that facilitate memorization and practical application. The careful balance between text and image demonstrates the integration of visual and textual learning methods essential to Tibetan medical pedagogy.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Access to this sophisticated medical knowledge was largely restricted to monastic communities and wealthy patrons who could afford manuscript commissioning. Rural populations often relied on folk healers with limited training, while formal medical education remained concentrated in major monasteries. Gender inequities were particularly pronounced, as formal medical training was primarily available to male monastics, though some female practitioners operated within more limited spheres. The expense of creating such detailed manuscripts meant that comprehensive medical knowledge remained concentrated among social elites.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Tibetan medicine conceptualizes illness through the lens of three humoral systems (nyé pa): wind (rlung), bile (mkhris pa), and phlegm (bad kan). Bloodletting and moxibustion address conditions arising from humoral imbalances, particularly those involving excessive heat, blood disorders, and blocked energy channels. The therapeutic approach targets specific points to restore equilibrium between these fundamental energies, treating conditions ranging from hypertension and inflammatory disorders to digestive complaints and neurological symptoms.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Practitioners identified candidates for bloodletting through pulse diagnosis, urine analysis, and visual examination revealing signs of blood disorders such as skin discoloration, localized swelling, or excessive heat. Moxibustion candidates presented with cold conditions, digestive weakness, or chronic fatigue. The specific point selection depended on symptom patterns, with practitioners mapping individual pathology onto this standardized anatomical template to determine optimal intervention sites.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Bloodletting involved creating small incisions at designated points using specialized instruments, allowing controlled blood release to reduce pathological heat and pressure. Moxibustion required burning small cones of dried artemisia (Artemisia vulgaris) on specific skin points to introduce therapeutic heat and stimulate energy flow. Both procedures required extensive training in point location, patient assessment, and procedural technique. Treatment timing followed lunar calendars and seasonal considerations integral to Tibetan medical theory.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Tibetan medical theory recognized that social factors including emotional stress, improper diet, and lifestyle imbalances contributed to humoral disruption requiring therapeutic intervention. Practitioners considered patients' occupational demands, family dynamics, and spiritual practices when prescribing treatment. The accessibility of these sophisticated interventions was heavily influenced by geographic location, social status, and economic resources, creating disparities in healthcare quality between urban monastery centers and remote rural communities.</p>
