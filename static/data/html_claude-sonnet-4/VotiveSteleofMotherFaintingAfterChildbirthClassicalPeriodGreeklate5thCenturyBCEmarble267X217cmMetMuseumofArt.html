        <h1>Votive Stele of Mother Fainting After Childbirth</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This marble relief sculpture was created by an anonymous Greek sculptor during the Classical period of ancient Greece. The work represents the artistic traditions of Attic sculptors who specialized in funerary and votive monuments, characterized by their refined technical skill and emotional sensitivity in depicting human experiences.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Dating to the late 5th century BCE, this votive stele emerged during the height of Classical Greek civilization, coinciding with the Golden Age of Athens under Pericles. This period saw remarkable developments in art, philosophy, and medicine, including the establishment of rational medical practice through figures like Hippocrates. Votive reliefs served as offerings to deities, particularly those associated with healing and childbirth, such as Artemis, Eileithyia, and Asclepius. The practice of commissioning such works reflected both religious devotion and the commemoration of significant life events, including the dangers of childbirth that claimed many women's lives in antiquity.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The relief depicts a dramatic moment of maternal collapse following childbirth, surrounded by attendant figures that likely represent family members and possibly a midwife or physician. The central seated figure's posture of weakness and the supporting gestures of the standing figures create a narrative of crisis and care. The inclusion of what appears to be medical or ritual implements suggests the intersection of religious and medical intervention. As a votive offering, the stele likely commemorates either survival from childbirth complications or serves as a memorial, invoking divine protection for future mothers.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The sculpture exemplifies Classical Greek artistic principles through its naturalistic representation of human figures, balanced composition, and emotional restraint characteristic of the period. The artist employs shallow relief carving that creates depth through subtle gradations in the marble surface. The drapery treatment demonstrates the Classical mastery of representing fabric flow and body structure beneath clothing. The composition follows the principle of isocephaly, with heads at similar levels creating visual harmony, while the central figure's collapse creates dramatic tension within the otherwise balanced arrangement.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The stele reflects the gendered medical experiences of ancient Greece, where childbirth was exclusively a women's domain, often attended by female midwives with limited medical training. The wealth required to commission such a marble relief indicates upper-class status, highlighting how commemoration of medical experiences was privilege-dependent. Lower-class women facing similar childbirth complications would have lacked both access to skilled medical care and the means to create lasting memorials of their experiences.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The scene likely depicts postpartum complications, potentially including hemorrhage, eclampsia, or puerperal sepsis. In the 5th century BCE, maternal mortality rates were extremely high due to limited understanding of antiseptic practices, blood loss management, and infection control. Postpartum hemorrhage, caused by uterine atony or retained placental fragments, was a leading cause of maternal death, as was puerperal fever resulting from bacterial infections introduced during delivery.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The central figure's collapsed posture, apparent weakness requiring support, and the concerned expressions of attendants suggest acute medical distress. The positioning indicates possible shock from blood loss, characterized by weakness, pallor, and altered consciousness. The presence of multiple attendant figures suggests the severity of the situation requiring immediate intervention and support.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Ancient Greek obstetric care relied primarily on empirical knowledge passed down through generations of midwives. Treatments for postpartum complications included herbal remedies, physical manipulation to expel retained placental tissue, and various folk remedies. Hippocratic medicine of this period began incorporating more systematic approaches, including dietary recommendations and environmental modifications, though surgical interventions remained limited and dangerous.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Maternal health outcomes in Classical Greece were significantly influenced by social class, with wealthy women having access to experienced midwives and better nutrition during pregnancy. Geographic location affected access to skilled birth attendants, while cultural practices regarding women's seclusion during childbirth could delay necessary medical intervention. The emphasis on large families for economic and political reasons meant repeated pregnancies that increased cumulative health risks for women.</p>
