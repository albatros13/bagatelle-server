        <h1>Michelangelo's Study of Anatomy</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) stands as one of the most influential artists of the Italian Renaissance. Born in Caprese, Italy, Michelangelo was a sculptor, painter, architect, and poet whose work exemplified the Renaissance ideal of the complete artist. His anatomical studies were integral to his artistic development, as he sought to understand the human form through direct observation and dissection.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>During the High Renaissance (approximately 1495-1520), there was a renewed interest in classical antiquity and scientific inquiry. This period coincided with significant developments in medical knowledge and anatomical study. The Church's gradual acceptance of human dissection for educational purposes allowed artists like Michelangelo to conduct anatomical investigations. These studies were essential for creating realistic human figures in art, representing a departure from the more stylized medieval representations of the human body.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The five sculptures depicted - Pieta, Moses, Victory, David, and Risen Christ - represent different aspects of human experience and divine connection. Each figure demonstrates Michelangelo's profound understanding of human anatomy while conveying spiritual and emotional themes. The muscular definition and anatomical precision serve not merely as artistic technique but as symbols of human dignity, divine creation, and the artist's ability to breathe life into stone.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo's anatomical studies reveal his mastery of contrapposto, chiaroscuro, and terribilità. His sculptures demonstrate precise understanding of muscle groups, bone structure, and the mechanics of human movement. The artist's use of line emphasizes the contours of the human form, while his manipulation of light and shadow creates dramatic three-dimensional effects. The principle of proportion, derived from classical ideals and direct anatomical observation, governs the construction of each figure.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo's anatomical studies were conducted primarily on male subjects and corpses of lower social classes, reflecting the gender and class inequities of Renaissance society. Women and wealthy individuals were rarely available for dissection, limiting the artist's exposure to diverse body types. This practice reinforced artistic conventions that idealized male forms while marginalizing other representations of human anatomy.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While these sculptures don't explicitly depict pathological conditions, Michelangelo's anatomical accuracy allows for medical analysis. The figures show idealized healthy human anatomy, though some scholars have noted potential signs of various conditions. For instance, some interpretations suggest certain muscular presentations might reflect understanding of specific anatomical variations or even pathological states that Michelangelo observed during his dissections.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The sculptures primarily represent healthy human anatomy, though careful examination reveals Michelangelo's awareness of anatomical variations. In some figures, asymmetries or unusual muscular presentations may reflect the artist's observation of cadavers that exhibited various physical conditions. However, these works emphasize physical perfection rather than pathological states, adhering to Renaissance ideals of beauty and proportion.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Michelangelo's era, medical treatments were limited and often based on humoral theory. The artist's anatomical studies contributed to growing medical knowledge that would eventually improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. His detailed observations of muscle, bone, and organ structure provided valuable documentation that informed both artistic and medical practices of the period.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The Renaissance period saw significant disparities in health outcomes based on social class, occupation, and access to resources. Michelangelo's subjects for anatomical study were primarily from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, reflecting how poverty and social marginalization made certain populations more vulnerable to disease and more likely to become subjects for medical and artistic investigation. The idealized bodies in his sculptures contrast sharply with the likely malnourished and disease-affected bodies he studied through dissection.</p>
