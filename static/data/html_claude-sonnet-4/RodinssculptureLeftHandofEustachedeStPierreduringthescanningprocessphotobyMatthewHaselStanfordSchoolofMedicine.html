        <h1>Rodin's Left Hand of Eustache de St Pierre: A Medical Imaging Analysis</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Auguste Rodin (1840-1917), the French sculptor renowned for revolutionizing modern sculpture, created this anatomically precise hand as part of his monumental work "The Burghers of Calais" (1884-1895). Rodin's meticulous approach to human anatomy stemmed from his extensive study of cadavers and live models, establishing him as both an artistic master and inadvertent anatomical documentarian.</p>
        
        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Created during the late 19th century, this sculpture emerged during a period of significant medical advancement and artistic realism. The Third Republic era in France (1870-1940) witnessed unprecedented collaboration between artists and medical professionals. Rodin's work coincided with the development of early radiographic techniques by Wilhelm Röntgen (1895), making this contemporary medical imaging analysis particularly poignant as it bridges 19th-century sculptural techniques with 21st-century diagnostic technology.</p>
        
        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The hand represents Eustache de Saint-Pierre, one of six burghers who offered their lives to save Calais during the Hundred Years' War. Symbolically, hands in Rodin's work conveyed emotional and spiritual states. This particular hand, with its gnarled appearance and prominent joint deformities, suggests the physical toll of age, stress, and potentially arthritis—conditions that would have been common among medieval civic leaders. The scanning process reveals internal structures that mirror the external emotional weight Rodin intended to convey.</p>
        
        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Rodin's sculptural technique demonstrates remarkable anatomical accuracy in depicting pathological conditions. The bronze casting reveals textural elements consistent with joint inflammation and possible osteoarthritic changes. The principles of emphasis and proportion are evident in the exaggerated knuckles and finger joints, while the patina and surface treatment create visual unity. The scanning images reveal how Rodin's understanding of internal anatomy informed his external modeling, creating depth and volume that accurately reflects underlying bone and soft tissue structures.</p>
        
        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The depicted hand pathology reflects broader socioeconomic health disparities of medieval and 19th-century society. Arthritis and joint deformities were occupational hazards for laborers and resulted from inadequate nutrition and healthcare access. Rodin's realistic portrayal inadvertently documents health inequities between social classes, as wealthy patrons would have had access to better nutrition and medical care, while common citizens suffered from preventable degenerative conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The scanning reveals features consistent with osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage breakdown and bone remodeling. Primary osteoarthritis results from mechanical wear and aging, while secondary forms develop from injury, infection, or metabolic disorders. The etiology includes genetic predisposition, mechanical stress, inflammatory processes, and environmental factors such as repetitive use patterns common in manual laborers of the medieval period.</p>
        
        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The medical imaging reveals classic osteoarthritic changes: joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation (bone spurs), subchondral sclerosis, and possible joint deformity. Visual markers include enlarged interphalangeal joints, characteristic of Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes, and asymmetric joint involvement. The bronze medium captures the external manifestations of these internal pathological processes, including joint swelling and finger deviation that would have caused functional impairment and chronic pain.</p>
        
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Medieval treatment options were limited to herbal remedies, heat application, and rest. Modern osteoarthritis management includes pharmacological interventions (NSAIDs, corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid injections), physical therapy, occupational therapy, and surgical options including joint replacement. The scanning technology itself represents diagnostic advancement that enables precise treatment planning impossible in Rodin's era or the historical period he depicted.</p>
        
        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The depicted pathology reflects multiple social determinants: occupational hazards from manual labor, nutritional deficiencies affecting bone health, limited healthcare access, and the chronic stress of civic responsibility during wartime. Economic factors influenced disease progression, as inability to rest affected joints would have accelerated degeneration. Geographic factors, including climate and living conditions, also contributed to joint disease prevalence in medieval Northern France.</p>
