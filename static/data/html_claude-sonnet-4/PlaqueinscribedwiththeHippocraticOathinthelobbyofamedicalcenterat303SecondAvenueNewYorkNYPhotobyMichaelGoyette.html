        <h1>The Hippocratic Oath Plaque: A Monument to Medical Ethics</h1>

        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This ornate plaque representing the Hippocratic Oath appears to be the work of early 20th-century American craftsmen, likely commissioned for institutional display. The elaborate decorative framework suggests collaboration between calligraphers, illuminators, and decorative artists working in the Arts and Crafts tradition. The piece reflects the institutional patronage common in medical centers seeking to establish their professional legitimacy through classical references.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Created during the early-to-mid 20th century, this plaque emerged during a pivotal period in American medical history when the profession was establishing standardized education and ethical practices. The Flexner Report of 1910 had recently transformed medical education, emphasizing scientific rigor and professional standards. This period saw increased efforts to legitimize medicine as a learned profession, often through displays of classical knowledge and ethical commitment. The plaque's placement in a New York medical center reflects the urbanization of healthcare and the rise of institutional medicine.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The plaque's iconography draws heavily from classical antiquity, invoking Apollo and Asclepius as divine witnesses to the physician's oath. The decorative borders feature Renaissance-inspired grotesques and classical motifs that connect modern medicine to ancient wisdom. The central text, presented in formal calligraphy, transforms the oath into a sacred document. The blue and gold color scheme suggests nobility and divinity, while the ornate framing elevates the text to the status of illuminated manuscript. Medical symbols including the caduceus and serpent reinforce the connection to Asclepian healing traditions.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The plaque demonstrates principles of hierarchical composition, with "THE OATH" prominently displayed at the top, followed by the main text in decreasing importance. The symmetrical border design creates visual balance while ornate lettering establishes rhythm and emphasis. The contrast between the dense decorative elements and clean text areas guides the viewer's eye through the content. Color is used strategically, with blue creating focal points and gold providing unity throughout the composition. The overall effect combines medieval manuscript illumination with Arts and Crafts movement aesthetics.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>While celebrating medical ethics, this plaque reflects the exclusionary nature of early 20th-century medicine. The classical references and formal presentation reinforced medicine as an elite profession accessible primarily to educated white males. The oath's original language about "freeborn" students and restrictions on certain procedures reflected ancient Greek social hierarchies. Women, minorities, and lower socioeconomic groups were systematically excluded from medical education during this period, making such displays symbols of professional privilege rather than universal healthcare commitment.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Rather than depicting specific diseases, this artwork addresses the broader concept of medical ethics as a remedy for professional misconduct and patient exploitation. The "disease" here is moral corruption within medical practice - the tendency toward greed, sexual impropriety, and breach of confidentiality that the oath seeks to prevent. The etiology of these professional ailments stems from the power imbalance between physician and patient, the intimate nature of medical encounters, and the economic incentives that can corrupt healing relationships.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The oath identifies several pathological signs of professional corruption: the temptation to "cut persons laboring under the stone" (performing surgery without proper training), "seduction of females or males," "voluntary act of mischief and corruption," and the breaking of patient confidentiality. These behaviors represent symptoms of a diseased professional relationship that undermines the healing mission. The formal, ritualistic presentation of the oath serves as both diagnostic tool and preventive measure against these professional pathologies.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>The Hippocratic Oath functions as both prevention and treatment for professional ethical disorders. The prescribed treatment involves ritual commitment to specific behavioral standards: maintaining professional boundaries, respecting patient confidentiality, refusing to perform procedures beyond one's competence, and prioritizing patient benefit over personal gain. The public display of the oath serves as ongoing therapy, providing constant reminder of professional obligations and community accountability.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The need for such ethical frameworks reflects social determinants including the professionalization of medicine, urbanization, and the commercialization of healthcare. As medicine moved from informal folk practice to formal institutional care, new power dynamics created opportunities for exploitation. The growing economic value of medical knowledge increased temptations for misconduct. Social factors like class distinctions, gender hierarchies, and racial prejudices influenced both who could practice medicine and how different patients were treated, necessitating explicit ethical guidelines.</p>
