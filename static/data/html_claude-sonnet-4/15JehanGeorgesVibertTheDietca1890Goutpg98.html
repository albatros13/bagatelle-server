        <h1>The Diet</h1>
        <h2>Jehan Georges Vibert (ca. 1890)</h2>

        <h3>Artist/Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>Jehan Georges Vibert (1840-1902) was a prominent French academic painter known for his satirical depictions of clergy and religious figures. A student of Félix-Joseph Barrias and later Eugène-François-Marie-Joseph Devéria, Vibert became celebrated for his meticulous technique and his ability to blend humor with social commentary. His works often featured cardinals, monks, and other ecclesiastical figures in situations that revealed human weaknesses and contradictions, making him a master of the genre painting tradition that flourished in 19th-century France.</p>

        <h3>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h3>
        <p>Created around 1890, "The Diet" emerged during the Third French Republic, a period marked by anticlericalism and growing criticism of the Catholic Church's wealth and influence. This era witnessed significant tensions between secular and religious authorities, with many French intellectuals and artists questioning the moral authority of church officials. Vibert's work reflects the bourgeois fascination with exposing clerical hypocrisy, particularly regarding vows of poverty and temperance. The painting's subject matter—a cardinal suffering from gout, a disease associated with excessive consumption—would have resonated with contemporary audiences familiar with debates about ecclesiastical privilege and excess.</p>

        <h3>Symbolism and Iconography</h3>
        <p>The painting's iconography is rich with symbolic elements that reinforce its satirical message. The cardinal's vibrant red robes, while liturgically appropriate, also symbolize indulgence and excess. The opulent interior, complete with ornate furnishings and decorative elements, contrasts sharply with expected clerical simplicity. The presence of what appears to be medical consultation in the background suggests the consequences of overindulgence. The cardinal's posture—reclining with evident discomfort—serves as a visual metaphor for the fall from spiritual grace through physical excess. The juxtaposition of religious authority and physical vulnerability creates a powerful commentary on human frailty.</p>

        <h3>Stylistic Significance</h3>
        <p>Vibert employs the academic realist style characteristic of 19th-century French salon painting. His meticulous attention to detail, particularly in rendering fabrics, furniture, and architectural elements, demonstrates technical mastery while serving the narrative purpose. The warm color palette, dominated by rich reds and golds, creates visual opulence while the careful modeling of light and shadow adds psychological depth. The composition uses diagonal lines to guide the viewer's eye from the suffering cardinal to the background figures, creating narrative tension. Vibert's precise brushwork and photographic clarity reflect the academic tradition's emphasis on technical perfection in service of storytelling.</p>

        <h3>Social/Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The painting highlights stark inequalities between the Catholic Church's wealth and the poverty of ordinary believers. By depicting a cardinal living in luxury while suffering from a disease of excess, Vibert critiques the disparity between clerical vows of poverty and the reality of ecclesiastical privilege. The work reflects broader 19th-century concerns about social justice and institutional hypocrisy, particularly relevant during a period when many French citizens struggled with economic hardship while church officials lived in comfort.</p>

        <h3>Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and soft tissues. The condition results from hyperuricemia—elevated levels of uric acid in the blood—which can occur due to overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. Primary causes include genetic predisposition, but lifestyle factors, particularly diet rich in purines (found in red meat, organ meats, shellfish, and alcohol), significantly contribute to its development. The disease was historically known as the "disease of kings" due to its association with rich foods and excessive alcohol consumption.</p>

        <h3>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The cardinal's posture and apparent discomfort likely represent classic gout symptoms. Acute gout typically manifests as sudden, severe joint pain, most commonly affecting the big toe but also ankles, knees, and other joints. The affected joints become red, swollen, and extremely tender. Patients often experience difficulty walking and may adopt protective postures to minimize pain. Chronic gout can lead to tophi—deposits of urate crystals under the skin—and joint deformation. The cardinal's obvious distress and inability to stand comfortably align with typical gout presentation.</p>

        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>In the 1890s, gout treatment was limited compared to modern options. Physicians typically recommended dietary modifications, particularly reducing consumption of red meat, organ meats, and alcohol. Colchicum (derived from autumn crocus) was used for acute attacks, while alkaline treatments and mineral waters were common remedies. Lifestyle changes, including moderation in diet and alcohol consumption, formed the cornerstone of management. The irony in Vibert's painting lies in the treatment requiring exactly the kind of temperance that the cardinal's comfortable lifestyle appears to contradict.</p>

        <h3>Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>Gout's social determinants are prominently displayed in Vibert's work. The cardinal's access to rich foods, fine wines, and sedentary lifestyle—privileges of his social position—directly contribute to his condition. The disease serves as a physical manifestation of social inequality, where wealth enables the very behaviors that cause illness. Additionally, the cardinal's access to medical care, evidenced by the consultation depicted in the background, contrasts with the limited healthcare available to common people of the era.</p>
