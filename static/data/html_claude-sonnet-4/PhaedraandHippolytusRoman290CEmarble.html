        <h1>Phaedra and Hippolytus: Love, Madness, and Moral Illness in Roman Art</h1>

        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This marble relief sarcophagus was created by unknown Roman sculptors during the late Imperial period, circa 290 CE. Roman sarcophagi of this era were typically produced in specialized workshops, often by Greek artisans working under Roman patronage or Roman craftsmen trained in Hellenistic traditions. These workshops created elaborate narrative reliefs for wealthy Roman families, combining mythological storytelling with sophisticated sculptural techniques inherited from Classical Greek art.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Created during the Crisis of the Third Century, this sarcophagus reflects the Roman Empire's complex relationship with Greek mythology and philosophy during a period of political instability. The late 3rd century marked a transition toward Christian influence, yet pagan mythological themes remained popular among the Roman elite. Sarcophagi served as status symbols and vehicles for moral instruction, with tragic myths like Phaedra and Hippolytus offering commentary on virtue, vice, and divine justice. The choice of this particular myth suggests the patron's education in classical literature and moral philosophy.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The relief depicts the tragic myth of Phaedra's destructive passion for her stepson Hippolytus. Phaedra, seated in distress on the left, embodies uncontrolled desire and moral corruption. Her posture and drapery suggest both physical and spiritual anguish. Hippolytus, depicted as an idealized young hunter, represents chastity and devotion to Diana. The surrounding figures likely include Phaedra's nurse, servants, and possibly allegorical representations of Love and Death. The hunting scene elements symbolize Hippolytus's pure devotion to Diana and his rejection of Aphrodite's domain, while Phaedra's positioning suggests the consuming nature of forbidden love.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The relief demonstrates the Roman adaptation of Hellenistic sculptural principles, with deeply carved figures creating dramatic chiaroscuro effects. The composition employs hierarchical scale and strategic placement to guide the viewer's eye across the narrative. Classical contrapposto poses are modified to express emotional states rather than mere physical beauty. The flowing drapery serves both decorative and expressive functions, with agitated folds reflecting psychological turmoil. The artist employs varying relief depths to create spatial recession while maintaining the frieze's overall unity through repeated vertical elements and rhythmic gesture patterns.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The sarcophagus reflects significant gender and class disparities in Roman society. Phaedra's portrayal as the destructive feminine force reinforces patriarchal views of women as emotionally unstable and morally dangerous when not properly controlled. The myth serves as a cautionary tale about female sexuality threatening male virtue and social order. Additionally, the expensive marble sarcophagus represents the extreme wealth disparity in late Imperial Rome, where elaborate funerary monuments were accessible only to the elite while the majority faced poverty and social instability.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Phaedra's condition represents what ancient sources described as "amor hereos" or lovesickness, understood as a form of melancholia caused by unrequited or forbidden love. Ancient physicians, influenced by humoral theory, attributed this condition to an excess of black bile combined with heated blood caused by passionate desire. The etiology was believed to involve both divine punishment (Aphrodite's curse) and natural susceptibility to emotional imbalance, particularly in women, who were considered more vulnerable to psychological disorders due to their supposedly weaker rational faculties.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The sculptural representation captures several symptoms associated with lovesickness as described in ancient medical texts. Phaedra's posture suggests physical weakness and emotional prostration, consistent with descriptions of amor hereos patients experiencing fatigue, loss of appetite, and melancholic withdrawal. Her veiled head and downward gaze indicate shame and mental anguish. The tension in her drapery and hand positions suggests the internal conflict between desire and moral duty that characterizes this psychological condition. Ancient physicians would have recognized these physical manifestations as indicators of serious mental disturbance.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Ancient treatment for lovesickness typically involved a combination of physical and psychological interventions. Physicians like Galen recommended dietary modifications to rebalance the humors, bloodletting to reduce excess heat, and herbal remedies including hellebore for melancholia. Psychological treatments included distraction through travel, entertainment, or new romantic attachments. Moral philosophers advocated rational discourse and ethical instruction to overcome destructive passions. In Phaedra's case, the myth suggests that only death could resolve the conflict between desire and moral duty, reflecting ancient beliefs about the potentially fatal nature of severe emotional disorders.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Phaedra's illness reflects broader social factors contributing to psychological distress in Roman society. Her position as a stepmother in a complex family structure created inherent tensions and moral ambiguities. The patriarchal marriage system, which often prioritized political alliance over personal compatibility, could generate emotional conflicts. Additionally, women's limited agency in Roman society meant they had few outlets for psychological distress beyond destructive behavior. The myth also reflects class-related factors, as aristocratic women faced particular pressures regarding reputation and moral conduct that could exacerbate psychological disorders.</p>
