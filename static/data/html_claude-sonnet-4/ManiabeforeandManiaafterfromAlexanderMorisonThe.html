        <h1>Mania before and Mania after - Alexander Morison</h1>

        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Alexander Morison (1779-1866) was a Scottish physician and pioneering psychiatrist who became one of the first medical professionals to systematically document mental illness through visual representation. As a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, Morison combined his medical expertise with artistic documentation to create what would become some of the earliest clinical illustrations of psychiatric conditions. His work represented a significant departure from traditional medical illustration by focusing specifically on the physiognomic manifestations of mental disorders.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>This illustration dates from the early 19th century (circa 1840s), during the height of the Victorian era when mental illness was poorly understood and heavily stigmatized. This period marked the transition from purely custodial care to the emergence of moral treatment and early psychiatric medicine. Morison's work coincided with the establishment of private madhouses and the gradual professionalization of psychiatry. The era was characterized by the belief that mental illness could be read through facial expressions and physical appearance, reflecting the influence of physiognomy and phrenology on medical practice. This was also a time when women's mental health was particularly pathologized, with conditions like hysteria and mania often attributed to female biology and social roles.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The dual representation of "before" and "after" mania serves as a powerful visual narrative of psychiatric treatment outcomes. The patient's positioning, clothing, and facial expression carry symbolic weight—the institutional dress suggests confinement and medical control, while the seated posture may indicate either resignation or recovery depending on interpretation. The clinical gaze inherent in these illustrations reflects the power dynamics between physician and patient, with the anonymous subject serving as a specimen for medical study rather than an individual with agency. The stark, unadorned background emphasizes the medical nature of the documentation while stripping away personal identity.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Morison's illustrations employ a realistic, observational style characteristic of scientific illustration. The line work is precise and economical, focusing attention on facial features and posture while minimizing distracting details. The composition uses principles of contrast to highlight the differences between the patient's states, with careful attention to proportion and anatomical accuracy. The monochromatic palette reinforces the clinical objectivity while the frontal positioning creates direct engagement with the viewer. These stylistic choices reflect the intersection of medical documentation and artistic representation, serving both scientific and pedagogical purposes.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Morison's work reflects significant gender, class, and power inequities of the Victorian era. Women were disproportionately diagnosed with mental illness and subjected to psychiatric treatment, often for behaviors that challenged social norms. The clinical documentation process itself represents a form of objectification, reducing patients to visual specimens for medical consumption. Access to treatment was largely determined by social class, with private patients receiving different care than pauper patients. The power dynamic between male physicians and female patients was particularly pronounced, with women having little agency in their diagnosis or treatment.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>In Morison's era, mania was understood as a form of mental derangement characterized by excessive excitement, agitation, and loss of rational control. The etiology was poorly understood, with theories ranging from moral causes (such as religious enthusiasm or unrequited love) to physical causes (including heredity, brain inflammation, or uterine disorders in women). Victorian physicians believed mania could be triggered by emotional stress, physical illness, or moral transgressions, reflecting the limited understanding of psychiatric neurobiology available at the time.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The illustration likely captures physiognomic signs that Victorian physicians associated with mania: altered facial expressions, changes in posture, and overall demeanor. Physicians of this era looked for signs such as wild or fixed staring, altered sleep patterns, rapid or pressured speech, and agitated motor behavior. The "before and after" format suggests documentation of visible changes following treatment, though the specific signs depicted would have been interpreted through the lens of 19th-century psychiatric theory rather than modern diagnostic criteria.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment for mania in Morison's time included moral treatment (structured routine, occupational therapy, and kind but firm management), physical restraints, hydrotherapy (cold baths), bloodletting, purging, and various medications including opium and mercury. The "after" image likely represents the results of such interventions, which aimed to restore calm and rational behavior. Treatment outcomes were often temporary, and the focus was on managing symptoms rather than addressing underlying causes.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Victorian society's rigid social expectations, particularly for women, contributed significantly to psychiatric diagnoses. Economic stress, limited educational and professional opportunities for women, restrictive gender roles, and social isolation were key factors. The stigma associated with mental illness often led to social exclusion and family shame, potentially exacerbating conditions. Class differences significantly affected access to treatment and quality of care, with wealthy patients receiving more humane treatment than those in public institutions.</p>
