        <h1>Anatomical Figure Showing Qi Channels (1800-1920)</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This anatomical figure represents the work of traditional Chinese medical practitioners and artisans during the late Qing Dynasty and early Republican period. Such figures were typically created by skilled craftsmen working in collaboration with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) physicians and scholars who possessed deep knowledge of meridian theory. These educational tools were produced in medical schools, monasteries, and workshops throughout China, representing a collective artistic and scientific tradition rather than individual authorship.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (1800-1920)</h2>
        <p>This period marked a crucial transition in Chinese medicine as Western medical practices began entering China through missionary hospitals and foreign settlements. The creation of such anatomical models represented both a preservation of traditional knowledge and an adaptation to new educational methodologies. During this era, China experienced significant social upheaval including the Opium Wars, Taiping Rebellion, and eventual fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912. Despite political turmoil, traditional medical practices remained deeply embedded in Chinese society, serving the majority of the population who lacked access to Western medicine.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The figure embodies fundamental TCM concepts of qi (vital energy) flow through specific pathways called meridians or channels. The linear markings represent the twelve primary meridians and eight extraordinary vessels that form the foundation of acupuncture theory. Chinese characters inscribed on the figure identify specific acupoints and organ systems, reflecting the integration of written knowledge with visual representation. The prone positioning suggests vulnerability and openness to treatment, while the serene facial expression conveys the harmony achieved through balanced qi flow.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The figure demonstrates classical Chinese artistic principles emphasizing balance, proportion, and functional beauty. Clean, precise lines create visual pathways that guide the viewer's eye along meridian routes, utilizing the principle of rhythm and movement. The neutral color palette and simplified anatomical features focus attention on the meridian system rather than individual characteristics. The three-dimensional form allows for tactile learning, representing a sophisticated understanding of educational design principles that engage multiple senses in the learning process.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Access to such sophisticated medical training tools was largely limited to male practitioners from educated classes, reflecting broader social hierarchies in imperial China. Women were generally excluded from formal medical education, though they often served as midwives and herbalists in their communities. Rural populations had limited access to trained TCM practitioners who possessed knowledge represented by such figures. The cost and craftsmanship required for these models meant they were primarily found in urban medical schools and wealthy households, creating disparities in medical education quality.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>In TCM theory, disease results from imbalanced or blocked qi flow through meridian channels. Etiology encompasses both internal factors (emotions, constitution, lifestyle) and external factors (climate, environment, pathogens). The meridian system depicted addresses conditions ranging from chronic pain and digestive disorders to emotional imbalances and organ dysfunction. TCM views illness as systemic disruption rather than localized pathology, emphasizing the interconnectedness of physical, emotional, and spiritual health.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Practitioners using such models would diagnose qi stagnation through pulse examination, tongue inspection, and palpation of acupoints marked on the figure. Signs of meridian dysfunction include tenderness along channel pathways, temperature variations, and changes in tissue texture. Each meridian connects to specific organs, so blockages manifest as corresponding symptoms: lung meridian issues causing respiratory problems, liver meridian stagnation creating emotional volatility, or kidney meridian weakness resulting in fatigue and reproductive concerns.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>The figure served as a treatment guide for acupuncture, moxibustion, and massage therapies. Practitioners would insert fine needles at specific points to restore qi balance, burn artemisia herb (moxa) to warm and stimulate channels, or apply pressure massage along meridian pathways. Treatment protocols varied based on individual constitution, seasonal influences, and symptom patterns. The model enabled precise point location, ensuring therapeutic accuracy and teaching proper needle depth and angle.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>TCM recognized social factors influencing health, including occupational hazards, poverty, and emotional stress from social disruption. During this historical period, opium addiction, malnutrition, and infectious diseases disproportionately affected lower socioeconomic classes. Traditional medicine provided affordable healthcare alternatives when Western treatments were unavailable or unaffordable. The meridian system addressed psychosocial health aspects often overlooked by purely biomedical approaches, recognizing connections between social environment and physical wellness.</p>
