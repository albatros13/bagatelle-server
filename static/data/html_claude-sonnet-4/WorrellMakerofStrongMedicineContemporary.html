        <h1>Maker of Strong Medicine</h1>
        <p><em>Contemporary sculpture by Worrell</em></p>

        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This contemporary sculpture is attributed to Worrell, an artist working within the tradition of Native American artistic expression. The work reflects Indigenous artistic practices that blend traditional spiritual concepts with contemporary sculptural techniques, representing the ongoing evolution of Native American art in the modern era.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Created in the contemporary period, this sculpture emerges from a time of cultural renaissance and healing within Native American communities. The late 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed increased efforts to preserve and revitalize Indigenous healing practices, languages, and spiritual traditions. This period has also seen growing recognition of traditional medicine's value alongside Western medical approaches, particularly in addressing health disparities affecting Native populations.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The figure's upward-reaching arms symbolize the connection between earthly healing and spiritual power, a fundamental concept in many Indigenous healing traditions. The turquoise coloration of the upper torso represents healing, protection, and spiritual purification in many Native American cultures. The elongated form suggests transformation and the channeling of spiritual energy, while the grounded base connects the healer to Mother Earth, the source of medicinal plants and healing power.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The sculpture employs verticality as its primary design principle, drawing the viewer's eye upward and emphasizing the spiritual dimension of healing. The contrast between the rough, natural stone base and the smooth, refined figure creates visual tension that speaks to the relationship between raw natural power and refined spiritual practice. The minimal yet expressive form demonstrates economy of line while maximizing symbolic impact, characteristic of contemporary Indigenous sculpture that distills traditional concepts into modern artistic language.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This artwork addresses the historical marginalization of Indigenous healing practices and medical knowledge systems. For centuries, Native American healing traditions were suppressed, criminalized, or dismissed as primitive by dominant Western society. The sculpture serves as a powerful statement about the legitimacy and importance of traditional healing practices, particularly relevant given the persistent health disparities affecting Native American communities, including higher rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health challenges.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Rather than depicting specific pathology, this work addresses the broader concept of spiritual and physical illness as understood in Indigenous worldviews. Traditional Native American medicine recognizes that disease often stems from spiritual imbalance, broken relationships with nature, community discord, or historical trauma. The etiology of illness encompasses not just biological factors but also emotional, spiritual, and social determinants that Western medicine has only recently begun to acknowledge.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The upward-reaching posture of the medicine maker suggests the active process of drawing healing energy and diagnosing spiritual ailments. In traditional practice, medicine people often serve as intermediaries who can perceive illness in its spiritual dimensions before physical symptoms manifest. The figure's openness and vulnerability indicate the empathetic connection required between healer and patient in Indigenous healing traditions.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>The sculpture embodies the holistic treatment approach characteristic of traditional Native American medicine, which integrates herbal remedies, ceremonial practices, prayer, and community involvement. The "strong medicine" referenced in the title encompasses not only potent plant medicines but also the spiritual power channeled through ceremony, song, and ritual. Treatment involves restoring balance between the individual, community, and natural world.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>This artwork implicitly addresses how historical trauma, cultural disruption, poverty, and social isolation contribute to illness in Native communities. The medicine maker represents a response to these social determinants through cultural healing practices that address root causes rather than merely treating symptoms. The work acknowledges that healing must occur at community and cultural levels, not just individual ones.</p>
