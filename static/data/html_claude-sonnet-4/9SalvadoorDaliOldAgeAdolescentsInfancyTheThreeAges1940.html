        <h1>Salvador Dalí - The Three Ages of Man (1940): A Surrealist Meditation on Mortality and Mental Decline</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist</h2>
        <p>Salvador Dalí (1904-1989) was a Spanish surrealist artist renowned for his technical virtuosity and bizarre, dreamlike imagery. A master of the "paranoiac-critical method," Dalí created works that explored the unconscious mind, sexual symbolism, and the nature of time and memory. His meticulous attention to detail and ability to render impossible scenarios with photographic precision made him one of the most recognizable artists of the 20th century.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Created in 1940, "The Three Ages of Man" emerged during a pivotal period in both Dalí's career and world history. The outbreak of World War II forced Dalí and his wife Gala to flee Europe for the United States, marking the beginning of his American period. This work reflects the broader cultural anxieties of the time, when concepts of mortality, decline, and the fragility of human existence were particularly resonant. The painting also coincides with advances in psychology and neuroscience, as Freudian psychoanalysis gained prominence and scientists began to better understand age-related cognitive decline.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting presents a complex visual metaphor for the human lifespan, with three distinct cavities representing infancy, adolescence, and old age. The architectural framework suggests both protection and confinement, while the landscape elements within each opening represent the expanding and contracting worlds of different life stages. The deteriorating quality of the figures from right to left symbolizes the progressive nature of aging and cognitive decline. The classical references to Renaissance portraiture, particularly in the beard and facial features, connect this work to art historical traditions of depicting the ages of man.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Dalí employs his characteristic hyperrealistic technique combined with surrealist distortion to create this complex composition. The principle of unity is achieved through the overarching architectural structure, while variety is introduced through the different scenes within each opening. The use of chiaroscuro creates dramatic contrasts that emphasize the temporal progression. The warm earth tones and cool blues create a psychological temperature map of human experience, with the repetition of organic forms creating visual rhythm across the three life stages.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting reflects the privileged male perspective of aging, notably absent of female representation or consideration of how gender, class, or socioeconomic status might affect the aging process. The idealized Renaissance-style portraiture suggests a European, upper-class model of aging that may not reflect the realities of different populations. The focus on cognitive and physical decline, while medically accurate, perpetuates potentially ageist attitudes that view older adults primarily through the lens of deterioration rather than wisdom or continued contribution.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While not depicting a specific disease, the painting illustrates the natural process of cognitive aging and potential neurodegenerative conditions. The progressive distortion of facial features and the fragmentation of the elderly figure suggest conditions such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease. These conditions result from the accumulation of protein deposits in the brain, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death. Age-related cognitive decline involves complex interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and the natural aging process of neural tissues.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The visual deterioration progressing from right to left serves as metaphorical representation of cognitive decline symptoms. The fragmented and distorted features of the elderly figure suggest disorientation, memory loss, and personality changes associated with dementia. The increasingly abstract nature of the scenes within each life stage opening may represent the progressive loss of clear thinking, decision-making abilities, and recognition of familiar people or places. The structural decay of the overall composition mirrors the breakdown of neural networks in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>In 1940, treatment options for age-related cognitive decline were extremely limited. Today, while there is no cure for conditions like Alzheimer's disease, treatments include cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists to temporarily slow symptom progression. Non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive stimulation therapy, physical exercise, and social engagement have shown benefits. Early detection through neuroimaging and biomarker testing has improved, allowing for earlier intervention and better planning for patients and families.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The painting's implicit focus on individual aging overlooks crucial social determinants that affect cognitive health outcomes. Educational attainment, socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, nutrition, social isolation, and environmental factors all significantly influence aging processes. Communities with better healthcare infrastructure, educational opportunities, and social support systems typically experience better aging outcomes. The artwork's individualistic perspective reflects mid-20th century attitudes that emphasized personal rather than systemic approaches to health and aging.</p>
