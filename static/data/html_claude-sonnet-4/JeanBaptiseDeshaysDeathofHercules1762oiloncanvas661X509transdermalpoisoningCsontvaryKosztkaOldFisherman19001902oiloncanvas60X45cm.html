        <h1>Transdermal Poisoning in Art: Medical Narratives Through Mythological and Social Realism</h1>

        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The upper painting depicts "Death of Hercules" by Jean Baptiste Deshays (1729-1765), a prominent French Rococo painter and winner of the Prix de Rome. The lower work is "Old Fisherman" by Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka (1853-1919), a Hungarian post-impressionist painter known for his visionary and symbolic works. Both artists represent distinct artistic traditions separated by over a century, yet both engaged with themes of human suffering and physical deterioration.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Deshays created his mythological scene in 1762 during the height of French Rococo, when classical mythology served as vehicles for exploring human passion and suffering. This period emphasized emotional expression and dramatic narrative. Csontváry's "Old Fisherman" (1900-1902) emerged during Hungary's cultural renaissance and the broader European symbolist movement, when artists increasingly focused on psychological states and social conditions of ordinary people. Both works reflect their respective periods' medical understanding of poisoning and illness.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>Deshays employs classical iconography of divine intervention and heroic death, with the centaur shirt of Nessus representing deception and inevitable doom. The composition suggests divine judgment and the consequences of betrayal. Csontváry's fisherman embodies the weathered laborer, his weathered hands and lined face serving as symbols of hard labor's toll on the human body. The maritime setting evokes both sustenance and danger, while the figure's intense gaze suggests awareness of his deteriorating condition.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Deshays demonstrates Rococo's dynamic composition through diagonal movement and warm color palette dominated by flesh tones and golden light. The muscular rendering of Hercules emphasizes physical strength succumbing to chemical assault. Csontváry employs post-impressionist techniques with bold brushstrokes and vivid colors, particularly in the subject's reddened face and hands, suggesting inflammation or exposure-related skin damage. Both artists use chiaroscuro to emphasize physical deterioration and suffering.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>While Deshays depicts mythological suffering of a heroic figure, Csontváry presents the reality of working-class vulnerability to occupational hazards. The fisherman's weathered appearance reflects limited access to protective equipment and medical care typical of early 20th-century laborers. This contrast highlights how artistic representation of illness often differed based on social class - mythological heroes versus anonymous workers bearing the burden of environmental and occupational health risks.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Hercules suffers from transdermal poisoning caused by the Hydra's blood-soaked shirt of Nessus, representing absorption of toxic substances through skin contact. The mythological poison causes systemic toxicity leading to organ failure and death. The fisherman displays signs consistent with chronic occupational exposure, possibly to marine toxins, sun damage, or other environmental hazards common to maritime workers. Both cases demonstrate how toxic substances can penetrate skin barriers and cause systemic illness.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>In Deshays' work, Hercules exhibits classic signs of acute poisoning: muscular rigidity, contorted posture, and apparent respiratory distress. His skin appears inflamed where the garment contacts his body. Csontváry's fisherman shows chronic exposure symptoms: hyperpigmentation, skin thickening, premature aging, and what appears to be dermatitis or sun damage on exposed areas. The reddened complexion and weathered skin texture suggest prolonged environmental exposure and possible vascular changes.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the mythological context, no treatment exists for Hercules' divine poison, leading to his transformation through immolation. This reflects 18th-century limitations in treating systemic poisoning. For the fisherman, treatment options in 1900-1902 would be limited to symptomatic care, perhaps including topical remedies for skin conditions and general supportive measures. Neither period possessed modern understanding of chelation therapy, antioxidants, or advanced toxicological interventions now used for chemical exposures.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Hercules' poisoning results from interpersonal betrayal rather than social conditions, though it reflects power dynamics and gender relations in mythological contexts. The fisherman's condition directly relates to occupational hazards, economic necessity forcing continued exposure to harmful environmental conditions, limited access to protective equipment, and inadequate healthcare for working populations. Geographic location, socioeconomic status, and occupational requirements create vulnerability to toxic exposures, particularly among maritime workers who face multiple environmental hazards including UV radiation, marine biotoxins, and harsh weather conditions.</p>
