        <h1>Mosquito Nets</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>John Singer Sargent (1856-1925) was an American expatriate artist renowned for his technical virtuosity and elegant portraiture. Born in Florence to American parents, Sargent received his artistic training in Paris under Carolus-Duran and became one of the most sought-after portrait painters of the Gilded Age. His work bridged academic tradition with impressionistic techniques, demonstrating exceptional skill in capturing light, texture, and intimate human moments.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Painted around 1908, "Mosquito Nets" emerged during a period of increasing awareness about tropical diseases and their vectors. The early 20th century marked significant advances in understanding malaria transmission, following Ronald Ross's Nobel Prize-winning discovery in 1902 that mosquitoes transmitted the disease. This knowledge revolutionized public health approaches in colonial territories and tropical regions. The painting reflects the upper-class leisure culture of the Edwardian era, where protective measures against disease were becoming fashionable necessities for wealthy travelers venturing into exotic locales.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The mosquito nets serve as both literal protective barriers and symbolic boundaries between civilization and the natural world's threats. The enclosed figures represent Western attempts to maintain comfort and cultural practices while confronting tropical dangers. The intimate scene of reading suggests the preservation of intellectual and domestic life within a protective cocoon. The nets create a liminal space—present but separate from the threatening environment, symbolizing the colonial mindset of cultural superiority maintained through technological intervention.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Sargent's masterful brushwork demonstrates his ability to render complex textures and atmospheric effects. The gossamer quality of the nets is achieved through delicate, translucent brushstrokes that create visual depth while maintaining the subjects' prominence. His use of warm earth tones contrasted with cooler shadows exemplifies his sophisticated color palette. The composition employs asymmetrical balance, with the figures positioned off-center but stabilized by the tent-like structure. The interplay of light filtering through the nets creates a sense of filtered reality, emphasizing both protection and confinement.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting embodies colonial privilege, depicting wealthy individuals with access to protective measures unavailable to indigenous populations most affected by mosquito-borne diseases. This disparity in disease prevention resources reflects broader patterns of colonial exploitation and medical inequality. While European colonizers could afford protective netting and had access to emerging medical knowledge, local populations often lacked such resources despite bearing the greatest disease burden in endemic regions.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Malaria, the primary disease mosquito nets prevent, is caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted through Anopheles mosquito bites. The parasite lifecycle involves both human and mosquito hosts, with female mosquitoes requiring blood meals for egg development. When infected mosquitoes bite humans, sporozoites enter the bloodstream, travel to the liver, multiply, and eventually infect red blood cells, causing the characteristic fever cycles and potentially fatal complications.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Malaria presents with cyclical fever patterns, chills, sweating, headache, and fatigue. Severe cases can progress to cerebral malaria, organ failure, and death. The disease's intermittent nature, with periods of apparent wellness followed by acute episodes, made it particularly feared by travelers. Other mosquito-borne diseases like yellow fever and dengue present similar initial symptoms but with distinct pathological progressions, all sharing the common vector that nets were designed to exclude.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>During Sargent's era, treatment options were limited primarily to quinine, derived from cinchona bark. Prevention through physical barriers like mosquito nets represented the most reliable protection. The nets, typically made of fine mesh or cheesecloth, created mechanical barriers preventing mosquito contact with sleeping individuals during peak biting hours. This prophylactic approach proved more effective than available therapeutic interventions of the time.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Access to protective measures like mosquito nets was determined by socioeconomic status, geographic location, and colonial power structures. Wealthy travelers could afford quality nets and other preventive measures, while indigenous populations in endemic areas often lacked such resources. Poor housing, inadequate sanitation, and limited healthcare access created conditions where mosquito-borne diseases disproportionately affected marginalized communities. The painting inadvertently documents these health disparities by showcasing privilege-based disease prevention.</p>
