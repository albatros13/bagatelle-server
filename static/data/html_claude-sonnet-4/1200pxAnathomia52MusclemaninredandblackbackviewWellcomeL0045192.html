        <h1>Anathomia: Muscle Man in Red and Black Back View</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This anatomical illustration originates from medieval European manuscript tradition, likely created by an unknown monastic scribe or scholarly physician working within the scholastic medical tradition. The work represents the collaborative efforts of medical practitioners who sought to preserve and transmit anatomical knowledge through illuminated manuscripts during an era when direct human dissection was largely prohibited by religious doctrine.</p>
        
        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Dating to approximately the 13th-15th centuries, this manuscript page emerges from the medieval period when European medical knowledge was heavily influenced by Islamic scholarship and classical Greek texts, particularly the works of Galen. During this time, medical education occurred primarily in cathedral schools and emerging universities, where theoretical knowledge took precedence over empirical observation. The Wellcome Collection's preservation of this work reflects the institutional effort to document the evolution of medical illustration and anatomical understanding before the Renaissance revolution in anatomical study.</p>
        
        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The posterior view of the muscular system carries profound symbolic weight within medieval medical cosmology. The red coloration of the muscles likely represents the vital humoral qualities associated with blood and heat, fundamental concepts in medieval physiology. The systematic arrangement of muscle groups reflects the medieval belief in divine order within the human body, considered a microcosm of the universe. The careful delineation of the spinal column emphasizes its role as the central axis of bodily function, while the extended arms suggest the cruciform symbolism prevalent in Christian medical imagery of the period.</p>
        
        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The illustration demonstrates characteristic medieval manuscript techniques, employing limited color palette dominated by red ochre and brown inks. The linear quality of the drawing emphasizes contour over volumetric modeling, reflecting the graphic conventions of manuscript illumination rather than naturalistic representation. The symmetrical composition and frontal presentation follow established iconographic formulas for depicting the human form. The use of negative space around the figure and the numbered notation system indicate this was designed as a pedagogical tool, prioritizing clarity of information over artistic expression.</p>
        
        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This manuscript represents knowledge accessible only to elite educated classes, primarily male clergy and physicians who possessed literacy in Latin. The creation and preservation of such works reinforced existing power structures within medieval society, where medical knowledge remained concentrated among privileged groups. The idealized male form depicted excludes consideration of female anatomy, racial diversity, or anatomical variations, reflecting the limited and biased perspective of medieval European medicine that marginalized women's medical knowledge and non-European healing traditions.</p>
        
        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>While this illustration depicts normal anatomical structure rather than pathological conditions, it serves as a baseline for understanding medieval concepts of muscular disorders. Medieval physicians attributed muscular ailments to imbalances in the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile), environmental factors, and divine punishment. Muscle weakness, pain, and paralysis were understood through humoral theory rather than specific disease mechanisms, leading to treatments focused on restoring bodily equilibrium.</p>
        
        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Medieval practitioners would have used such anatomical references to identify deviations from normal muscular presentation. Visible signs of muscular pathology included asymmetry, atrophy, abnormal coloration, and loss of function. The systematic mapping shown in this illustration provided a framework for identifying areas of muscular dysfunction, though without understanding of neurological, vascular, or inflammatory etiologies that modern medicine recognizes as underlying causes of muscular pathology.</p>
        
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Therapeutic approaches to muscular conditions during this period included bloodletting, herbal remedies, dietary modifications, and physical manipulation. Treatments aimed to restore humoral balance through purging, warming or cooling therapies, and the application of poultices. Monastic medicine incorporated prayer, pilgrimage, and holy relics alongside physical remedies, reflecting the integrated spiritual-medical worldview of the medieval period.</p>
        
        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Access to medical knowledge and treatment depicted in such manuscripts was severely limited by social class, geographic location, and religious affiliation. Peasant populations relied primarily on folk healing traditions and local wise women, while aristocratic and clerical classes had access to university-trained physicians. The preservation of anatomical knowledge in expensive illuminated manuscripts reinforced these disparities, contributing to differential health outcomes based on social position and economic resources.</p>
