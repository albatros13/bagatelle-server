        <h1>The Stele of Ruma: Ancient Egyptian Documentation of Poliomyelitis</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This limestone stele was created by anonymous Egyptian artisans during the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom period. The work represents the sophisticated artistic traditions of ancient Egyptian sculptors and relief carvers who worked within the established conventions of hieratic art. These craftsmen operated within temple workshops and were skilled in both hieroglyphic inscription and figural representation, creating works that served both religious and commemorative purposes.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Dating to approximately 1403-1365 BCE during the 18th Dynasty, this stele originates from one of ancient Egypt's most prosperous periods. The New Kingdom era was characterized by territorial expansion, cultural flowering, and extensive trade relationships. The stele was discovered at the sanctuary of Astarte in Memphis, indicating the cosmopolitan nature of Egyptian religious practices during this period, as Astarte was originally a Canaanite goddess who had been incorporated into the Egyptian pantheon. This period saw increased international contact, which may have facilitated the spread of infectious diseases like poliomyelitis.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The stele depicts Ruma, identified as a priest, in traditional Egyptian artistic style. The hierarchical scale and frontal presentation follow conventional Egyptian artistic protocols for depicting religious figures. The inclusion of hieroglyphic inscriptions provides both identification and religious context. The figure's physical condition, particularly the apparent limb deformity, serves as both personal identifier and medical documentation. The religious iconography suggests that Ruma maintained his spiritual authority despite his physical condition, reflecting Egyptian attitudes toward disability within religious contexts.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The stele exemplifies classic Egyptian relief carving techniques, utilizing raised relief and incised hieroglyphs. The composition demonstrates the Egyptian principle of hierarchical proportion, where the central figure dominates the visual field. The linear quality of Egyptian art is evident in the clear contour lines and schematic representation of the human form. The integration of text and image reflects the Egyptian concept of art as functional communication rather than mere decoration. The artistic treatment of physical disability shows remarkable naturalistic observation within the constraints of Egyptian artistic conventions.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Despite his apparent physical disability, Ruma's status as a priest suggests that ancient Egyptian society, at least within religious contexts, could accommodate individuals with physical impairments in positions of authority. However, this tolerance may have been limited to the priestly class and not extended to common laborers or slaves. The creation of a commemorative stele indicates Ruma's elevated social status, suggesting that disability's social impact was mediated by class position and religious role.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Poliomyelitis is a viral infectious disease caused by the poliovirus, which primarily affects the nervous system. The virus spreads through person-to-person contact, typically via the fecal-oral route or contaminated water and food. In ancient Egypt, the Nile River's annual flooding and dense urban populations would have created ideal conditions for viral transmission. The disease predominantly affects children under five years of age, though adults can also be infected.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The stele appears to document the characteristic asymmetric limb paralysis associated with paralytic poliomyelitis. The figure shows evidence of muscle atrophy and limb deformity consistent with the long-term effects of polio infection. The uneven stance and apparent reliance on support suggest the flaccid paralysis typical of anterior horn cell damage caused by the poliovirus. These physical manifestations would have developed during childhood and remained permanent, explaining the adult presentation of established deformity.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>In ancient Egypt, treatment for poliomyelitis would have been limited to supportive care and religious intervention. Egyptian medical papyri describe various treatments for paralysis, including massage, herbal remedies, and incantations. The association with the temple of Astarte suggests that religious healing rituals may have been employed. Physical support devices, possibly including primitive orthotic aids or walking supports, might have been utilized, though no specific evidence exists for polio treatment in ancient Egyptian medical texts.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The prevalence of poliomyelitis in ancient Egypt would have been influenced by population density, sanitation practices, and water management systems. The annual Nile flooding, while agriculturally beneficial, created conditions favorable for viral transmission through contaminated water sources. Social stratification may have influenced exposure risk, with lower-class individuals living in more crowded conditions with poor sanitation facing higher infection rates. However, the disease's ability to cross social boundaries is evidenced by its apparent presence among the priestly class.</p>
