        <h1>Medieval Zodiac Man: Astrological Medicine and the Human Body</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This illuminated manuscript represents the work of medieval monastic scribes and illuminators, likely produced in a European monastery during the late medieval period. The creation of such medical manuscripts was typically a collaborative effort between learned monks who possessed knowledge of both religious and secular texts, including medical treatises derived from ancient Greek, Arabic, and Latin sources.</p>
        
        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>This Zodiac Man manuscript dates to approximately the 14th-15th centuries, during the height of medieval scholasticism when astrological medicine dominated European medical practice. This period saw the synthesis of Aristotelian philosophy, Islamic medical knowledge, and Christian theology. Universities were establishing medical faculties, and physicians relied heavily on astrological charts to determine optimal times for medical procedures, bloodletting, and the administration of medicines. The manuscript reflects the medieval worldview that positioned humans as microcosms of the larger universe, with celestial bodies directly influencing bodily health and disease.</p>
        
        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The central figure represents the "Zodiac Man" or "Homo Signorum," with lines connecting each zodiacal sign to specific body parts. This iconography symbolizes the fundamental medieval belief in the correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm. Each zodiac sign governs particular anatomical regions: Aries rules the head, Taurus the neck and throat, Gemini the arms and shoulders, continuing down to Pisces governing the feet. The surrounding circular medallions contain zodiacal symbols and associated imagery, while the Gothic script provides instructions for medical practitioners on timing treatments according to celestial influences.</p>
        
        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The manuscript demonstrates typical medieval illumination techniques, employing tempera and ink on parchment. The composition utilizes radial symmetry, with the human figure as the central organizing principle. Color symbolism is evident in the use of red for internal organs, suggesting vital force and blood, while earth tones dominate the zodiacal imagery. The linear quality of the connecting lines emphasizes the direct relationships between celestial and corporeal realms. The integration of text and image reflects the medieval tradition of combining written knowledge with visual instruction, making complex medical concepts accessible to practitioners who might have varying levels of literacy.</p>
        
        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This manuscript represents medicine available primarily to educated elites and wealthy patrons who could afford university-trained physicians. The Latin text excluded the majority of the population who relied on folk healers, midwives, and herbalists. Astrological medicine required expensive ephemerides and calculation tools, creating a two-tiered medical system. Women were largely excluded from formal medical training, though they often possessed extensive practical knowledge of healing. The manuscript's existence in a religious context also reflects the Church's control over medical knowledge and the exclusion of Jewish and Islamic medical practitioners despite their significant contributions to the field.</p>
        
        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Medieval medical theory, as represented in this manuscript, attributed disease to imbalances in the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile) influenced by planetary positions. Disease etiology was understood through the lens of astrological influence, seasonal changes, and divine will. Physicians believed that planetary conjunctions, eclipses, and the patient's natal chart directly affected health outcomes. This holistic approach considered not just physical symptoms but also the patient's emotional state, diet, and spiritual condition as interconnected factors in disease causation.</p>
        
        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Medieval physicians interpreted illness through astrological frameworks, examining the patient's complexion, pulse quality, urine color and consistency, and the positioning of celestial bodies at the time of illness onset. The Zodiac Man provided a diagnostic map for identifying which body systems were most vulnerable based on current planetary influences. Practitioners would assess symptoms in relation to the patient's astrological constitution, looking for correspondences between celestial events and physical manifestations of disease.</p>
        
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment protocols depicted in such manuscripts emphasized timing medical interventions according to favorable astrological conditions. Bloodletting, the most common therapeutic intervention, was performed when the moon was in appropriate zodiacal signs. Herbal medicines were prepared and administered according to planetary hours, while surgical procedures were avoided during certain celestial configurations. Treatment also included dietary modifications, purging, and spiritual remedies such as prayer and pilgrimage.</p>
        
        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>While not explicitly recognized in medieval medical theory, social determinants profoundly influenced health outcomes. Access to clean water, adequate nutrition, and sanitary living conditions varied dramatically by social class. Urban crowding facilitated disease transmission, while rural populations faced different challenges. The manuscript represents elite medical knowledge that remained largely inaccessible to those most vulnerable to illness due to poverty, social marginalization, and lack of education.</p>
