        <h1>Lam Qua - A Chinese Lady Lo Wanshun from Guangzhou with a Tumour on her Left Cheek (1836)</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist</h2>
        <p>Lam Qua (關喬昌, c. 1801-1860) was a pioneering Chinese painter who became the first known Chinese artist to specialize in Western-style oil painting. Born Guan Qiaochang, he adopted the Western name "Lam Qua" for his international practice. Working primarily in Canton (Guangzhou), he established himself as a prominent portrait painter serving both Chinese and Western clients during the height of the China trade period.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>This portrait was created in 1836, during the late Qing Dynasty and at the height of the Canton System trade period (1757-1842). Canton was the only Chinese port open to Western merchants, creating a unique cultural exchange environment. This era witnessed significant medical collaboration between Western missionary doctors and Chinese patients, particularly through the work of Dr. Peter Parker, an American medical missionary who established the Canton Hospital in 1835. Lam Qua's medical portraits documented patients treated by Parker, creating an unprecedented visual medical record that bridged Eastern and Western medical practices.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The portrait embodies a complex intersection of cultural symbolism. Lo Wanshun is depicted in traditional Chinese dress, maintaining her dignity and social status despite her medical condition. Her formal seated pose on a traditional Chinese chair signifies respect and personhood, challenging Western colonial tendencies to dehumanize medical subjects. The clinical presentation of the facial tumor serves as both medical documentation and artistic statement, refusing to hide or minimize the subject's condition while preserving her humanity through careful attention to dress, posture, and expression.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The painting demonstrates Lam Qua's mastery of Western oil painting techniques applied to Chinese subject matter. The composition employs Western principles of linear perspective and chiaroscuro lighting, while maintaining Chinese aesthetic sensibilities in the treatment of fabric textures and color harmonies. The artist's use of precise anatomical detail reflects his collaboration with Western medical professionals, while the formal composition honors traditional Chinese portraiture conventions. The balanced asymmetry created by the prominent tumor creates visual tension while maintaining overall compositional harmony.</p>

        <h2>Social and Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This portrait illuminates several layers of social inequality. As a woman in 19th-century China, Lo Wanshun faced limited access to medical care and social mobility. Her prominent facial deformity would have further marginalized her within Confucian society, which emphasized physical perfection and social harmony. The fact that she sought treatment from foreign doctors suggests either desperation due to inadequate local medical options or potentially higher social status enabling access to experimental Western medicine. The portrait's existence also highlights the colonial medical gaze, where Chinese patients became subjects of Western medical study and documentation.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease and Etiology</h2>
        <p>The large, well-circumscribed mass on Lo Wanshun's left cheek appears consistent with a benign soft tissue tumor, possibly a lipoma, fibroma, or cystic lesion. The smooth, rounded appearance and apparent lack of surface ulceration suggest a slowly growing, encapsulated tumor rather than an aggressive malignancy. Such growths could result from various etiologies including genetic predisposition, chronic inflammation, or developmental anomalies. In the 19th century, limited understanding of tumor biology meant that most masses were classified simply as "tumors" without specific histological diagnosis.</p>

        <h2>Pathological Signs and Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The portrait reveals a large, ovoid mass measuring approximately 8-10 cm in diameter, extending from the left maxillary region to the mandible. The tumor appears to have smooth margins and uniform density, suggesting benign characteristics. Notable is the absence of visible surface changes, ulceration, or surrounding inflammation that might indicate malignancy. The patient's overall appearance suggests good general health despite the prominent facial deformity, indicating the tumor's likely benign nature and slow growth pattern.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>In 1836, surgical options were extremely limited due to lack of anesthesia and antiseptic techniques. Dr. Parker, known for his surgical skills, would have considered surgical excision as the primary treatment option, though such procedures carried enormous risks including hemorrhage, infection, and death. Traditional Chinese medicine might have attempted herbal treatments or acupuncture, though these would likely have been ineffective for such large masses. The patient's decision to seek Western medical consultation suggests either failure of traditional treatments or the tumor's progression to a size requiring surgical intervention.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Multiple social factors influenced Lo Wanshun's medical journey. Gender inequality in Qing Dynasty China limited women's access to medical care and social participation. Economic factors determined access to specialized treatments, particularly expensive foreign medical services. Geographic location in Canton provided unique access to Western medicine unavailable elsewhere in China. Cultural stigma surrounding physical deformities would have affected her social interactions and marriage prospects. The intersection of colonialism and medicine created both opportunities for advanced treatment and risks of exploitation as a medical curiosity.</p>
