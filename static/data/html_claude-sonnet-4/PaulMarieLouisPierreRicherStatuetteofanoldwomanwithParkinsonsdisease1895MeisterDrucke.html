        <h1>Statuette of an Old Woman with Parkinson's Disease (1895)</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Paul Marie Louis Pierre Richer (1849-1933) was a French anatomist, physiologist, and sculptor who worked at the intersection of medical science and artistic representation. Richer served as chief of anatomical work at the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris under the renowned neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot. His unique position allowed him to combine rigorous scientific observation with artistic skill, creating works that served both educational and documentary purposes in the emerging field of neurology.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Created in 1895, this statuette emerged during a pivotal period in medical history when neurological disorders were being systematically studied and classified for the first time. The late 19th century marked the golden age of clinical neurology, particularly at the Salpêtrière Hospital, which became the epicenter of neurological research under Charcot's leadership. This era coincided with the development of photography and other documentation methods for medical cases, yet Richer's three-dimensional sculptural approach offered unique insights into the physical manifestations of neurological conditions. The work reflects the positivist scientific culture of fin-de-siècle France, where empirical observation and detailed documentation were paramount to medical advancement.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The dual presentation of the figure from front and side views reflects the clinical methodology of comprehensive patient examination and documentation. The nudity of the figure, while serving scientific purposes, also evokes classical sculptural traditions that celebrate the human form, here transformed to reveal the vulnerability of the aging body affected by disease. The positioning and posture become symbolic of the loss of bodily autonomy characteristic of Parkinson's disease, while the careful attention to anatomical detail elevates the subject from mere medical specimen to a dignified representation of human suffering and resilience.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Richer's sculpture demonstrates masterful attention to form, texture, and proportion in service of scientific accuracy. The work exhibits naturalistic modeling that captures the subtle asymmetries and muscular tensions characteristic of Parkinson's disease. The artist employs principles of contrast through the juxtaposition of the two viewing angles, allowing for comprehensive observation of the subject's condition. The sculpture's surface treatment reveals careful attention to the representation of aged skin, muscle atrophy, and postural deformities. The monochromatic palette emphasizes form over color, directing attention to the essential elements of bodily posture and expression that define the neurological condition.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The work reflects the complex power dynamics inherent in 19th-century medical practice, particularly regarding elderly women patients who often became subjects of clinical study with limited agency or consent. The institutional setting of the Salpêtrière, originally a hospice for indigent women, highlights issues of class and gender in medical treatment. Patients were frequently from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and became research subjects due to their dependence on charitable medical care. The artistic representation, while scientifically valuable, raises questions about dignity, consent, and the commodification of suffering for educational purposes.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Parkinson's disease, first clinically described by James Parkinson in 1817 as "shaking palsy," is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the central nervous system. The condition results from the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain. While the exact etiology remains complex and multifactorial, current understanding points to a combination of genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and aging processes that contribute to neuronal degeneration. The disease typically manifests after age 60, though early-onset forms exist, and affects motor control, coordination, and eventually cognitive function.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Richer's sculpture meticulously captures the cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease: the characteristic stooped posture (camptocormia), flexed positioning of the arms and hands, and the rigid, mask-like facial expression. The forward-leaning stance and bent knees reflect the postural instability and gait abnormalities associated with the condition. The positioning of the hands suggests the pill-rolling tremor characteristic of the disease, while the overall muscular tension visible in the sculpture represents the rigidity that affects patients' movement and comfort.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>In 1895, treatment options for Parkinson's disease were extremely limited and largely symptomatic. Physicians might prescribe rest, hydrotherapy, massage, or various tonics and medications with little therapeutic value. The discovery of levodopa therapy would not occur until the mid-20th century. Patients often received palliative care focused on comfort rather than disease modification, and many were institutionalized in facilities like the Salpêtrière when family care became impossible.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The 19th-century understanding of Parkinson's disease was limited by social factors including gender bias in medical research, socioeconomic barriers to care, and the stigmatization of neurological disorders. Elderly women, particularly those from lower social classes, faced multiple disadvantages in receiving appropriate care and were often institutionalized rather than treated. The social isolation and lack of family support systems available to many patients exacerbated the psychological impact of the disease, while limited understanding of the condition led to misattribution of symptoms to moral or character defects.</p>
