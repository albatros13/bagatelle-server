        <h1>Christ Healing the Man with Palsy</h1>
        <h2>Church of Christ the Consoler, Skelton Cum Newby</h2>

        <h3>Artist/Group/Tribe</h3>
        <p>This stained glass window is housed in the Church of Christ the Consoler in Skelton Cum Newby, Yorkshire, England. The church was built in 1871-1878 as a memorial church commissioned by Mary Vyner following the death of her son Frederick Grantham Vyner. The stained glass work demonstrates the craftsmanship typical of the Victorian Gothic Revival period, likely executed by one of the prominent stained glass workshops of the era such as Clayton and Bell or Heaton, Butler and Bayne, who were known for their ecclesiastical commissions during this period.</p>

        <h3>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h3>
        <p>Created during the height of the Victorian era (late 19th century), this window reflects the period's renewed interest in medieval Gothic art and Christian iconography. The Victorian period saw a resurgence in church building and restoration, driven by the Oxford Movement and Gothic Revival architecture. This was an era when the Anglican Church sought to reconnect with its medieval roots while addressing contemporary social concerns through Christian charitable work. The choice to depict healing miracles reflected Victorian society's growing awareness of public health issues and the church's role in providing comfort to the afflicted.</p>

        <h3>Symbolism and Iconography</h3>
        <p>The window depicts the biblical narrative from Matthew 9:1-8, Mark 2:1-12, and Luke 5:17-26, where Christ heals a paralytic man. The composition shows Jesus as the central figure, identifiable by his traditional iconography including a nimbus (halo) and flowing robes. The afflicted man is positioned lower in the composition, emphasizing the hierarchical relationship between divine healer and patient. The architectural setting with stone blocks references the biblical account where the man was lowered through a roof. The presence of witnesses, likely the apostles, reinforces the public nature of the miracle and serves as testament to Christ's healing power.</p>

        <h3>Stylistic Significance</h3>
        <p>The window exemplifies Victorian stained glass artistry through its vibrant color palette of deep blues, purples, reds, and golds achieved through pot metal and silver stain techniques. The composition employs strong lead lines that create geometric divisions while maintaining narrative flow. The figures demonstrate naturalistic proportions and expressions characteristic of 19th-century religious art, moving away from the more stylized medieval tradition. The artist employs principles of emphasis through color contrast and hierarchical scaling, with Christ's figure dominating the central space. The use of light and shadow creates depth and dimensionality within the confines of the medium.</p>

        <h3>Social/Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The artwork reflects Victorian social hierarchies and attitudes toward disability. The paralytic man is depicted in a position of complete dependence, reinforcing contemporary views of disabled individuals as objects of charity rather than autonomous persons. The scene emphasizes divine intervention over medical treatment, reflecting the limited understanding of neurological conditions and the church's role as primary caregiver for the disabled. This representation perpetuates the medicalization of disability within a religious framework that often viewed physical ailments as spiritual trials or divine punishment.</p>

        <h3>Description of Disease & Etiology</h3>
        <p>The biblical term "palsy" encompasses various neurological conditions causing paralysis or motor dysfunction. Modern medical understanding suggests the condition could represent several diagnoses including stroke (cerebrovascular accident), spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, or progressive neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The etiology varies significantly depending on the specific condition: strokes result from vascular compromise, spinal injuries from trauma, cerebral palsy from perinatal brain damage, and multiple sclerosis from autoimmune demyelination of neural pathways.</p>

        <h3>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>The artistic representation shows the classic presentation of paralysis: the man's inability to support himself, requiring assistance for mobility, and his positioning on what appears to be a stretcher or mat. His posture suggests lower extremity paralysis, consistent with paraplegia. The facial expression and body language convey the chronic nature of his condition, while his apparent conscious state rules out conditions affecting cognitive function. The biblical accounts describe him as "sick of the palsy," indicating a recognized, ongoing neurological impairment affecting motor function.</p>

        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>In the biblical and historical context, treatment options for paralysis were extremely limited. Ancient medicine relied primarily on rest, herbal remedies, and spiritual intervention. The narrative emphasizes faith-based healing over medical intervention, reflecting the era's understanding of divine authority over physical ailments. Modern treatment for similar conditions would include physical therapy, occupational therapy, assistive devices, medications for spasticity or underlying conditions, and in some cases, surgical interventions depending on the underlying pathology.</p>

        <h3>Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The biblical account reflects ancient social structures where disabled individuals often depended on family networks and community charity for survival. Poverty, limited access to medical care, social stigma, and exclusion from religious and social activities compounded the physical challenges of paralysis. The need for friends to transport the man to Jesus illustrates the importance of social support systems. In contemporary contexts, similar conditions are influenced by access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, educational opportunities, and social inclusion policies that determine quality of life for individuals with disabilities.</p>
