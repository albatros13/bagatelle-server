        <h1>Michelangelo's Last Judgement: A Medical and Art Historical Analysis</h1>

        <h2>Artist</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) stands as one of history's most celebrated Renaissance masters. Born in Caprese, Italy, Michelangelo was a polymath whose expertise spanned sculpture, painting, architecture, and poetry. His deep understanding of human anatomy, gained through dissection of cadavers, profoundly influenced his artistic representations of the human form and medical conditions.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>The Last Judgement was painted between 1536 and 1541 on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel during the height of the Counter-Reformation. This period was marked by the Catholic Church's response to Protestant criticism and internal corruption. The plague had repeatedly devastated Europe, with major outbreaks in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, making death and divine judgment central concerns. The fresco reflects the anxiety of an era grappling with mortality, religious reform, and the human condition amid widespread disease and social upheaval.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The composition centers on Christ as judge, surrounded by saints, apostles, and the resurrected dead. Saint Bartholomew holds his flayed skin, which bears Michelangelo's self-portrait, symbolizing spiritual death and rebirth. The imagery of resurrection includes bodies rising from graves, some appearing skeletal or partially decomposed, representing various stages of death and decay. Angels carrying instruments of Christ's passion serve as symbols of salvation, while the damned display physical manifestations of spiritual corruption through bodily distortion and disease-like symptoms.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo employs dramatic chiaroscuro to create psychological intensity, with muscular figures demonstrating his mastery of anatomical accuracy. The composition uses dynamic movement and serpentine poses to convey spiritual transformation. Color symbolism includes the blue of divine heaven contrasted with earthier tones of human flesh. The artist's knowledge of medical anatomy is evident in his precise rendering of musculature, bone structure, and pathological conditions affecting various figures throughout the composition.</p>

        <h2>Social and Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The fresco reflects Renaissance hierarchies where social status influenced access to medical care and spiritual salvation. The idealized muscular bodies represent classical perfection accessible primarily to the wealthy, while distorted figures of the damned may reflect the physical consequences of poverty, malnutrition, and limited healthcare. The positioning of figures also suggests class distinctions, with saints and blessed souls occupying privileged spaces while the suffering masses cluster below, mirroring earthly social stratification.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease and Etiology</h2>
        <p>Several figures display symptoms consistent with bubonic plague, which devastated Europe during Michelangelo's lifetime. The disease, caused by Yersinia pestis bacteria transmitted through flea bites from infected rodents, manifested in multiple forms: bubonic (lymph node swelling), pneumonic (respiratory), and septicemic (blood poisoning). The artist's anatomical studies likely exposed him to plague victims, informing his depictions of disease symptomatology within the religious narrative.</p>

        <h2>Pathological Signs and Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo depicts various pathological indicators throughout the composition. Some figures exhibit swollen lymph nodes characteristic of bubonic plague, while others show signs of wasting diseases, possibly representing tuberculosis or other chronic conditions. Skeletal figures rising from graves demonstrate advanced decomposition and bone pathology. Skin discoloration, muscular atrophy, and respiratory distress are subtly incorporated into the spiritual narrative, with physical suffering serving as visual metaphors for spiritual corruption and divine punishment.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Renaissance medical treatment for plague included bloodletting, herbal remedies, and quarantine measures. Physicians prescribed theriac (a compound antidote), applied poultices to buboes, and recommended fleeing infected areas. Religious treatment involved prayer, pilgrimage, and confession, reflecting the belief that disease was divine punishment for sin. The fresco itself served as both artistic achievement and spiritual medicine, offering viewers contemplation of mortality and potential redemption through divine grace.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The plague disproportionately affected the poor, who lived in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions with limited access to medical care or means of escape. Malnutrition, occupational hazards, and social stress increased vulnerability to disease among lower classes. Michelangelo's depiction reflects these inequities through the contrast between idealized holy figures and the suffering masses, suggesting how social position influenced both earthly health outcomes and perceived spiritual destiny within Renaissance worldview.</p>
