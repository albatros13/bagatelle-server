        <h1>Edward Munch Self Portrait with Spanish Flu (1919)</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist</h2>
        <p>Edvard Munch (1863-1944), the Norwegian expressionist painter, created this powerful self-portrait during his recovery from the Spanish flu in 1919. Munch, renowned for his emotionally charged works including "The Scream," was a master of depicting psychological states and human suffering through his distinctive expressionist style. At age 56, Munch had already established himself as a pivotal figure in modern art, known for his ability to translate internal emotional experiences into vivid visual representations.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>This self-portrait emerged during the devastating 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, which killed an estimated 50-100 million people worldwide. Created in the aftermath of World War I, the painting reflects the profound trauma and uncertainty of the era. Norway, despite its neutrality during the war, was severely affected by the pandemic. Munch contracted the flu in the autumn of 1918 and painted this work during his convalescence in 1919. The painting represents both personal recovery and collective trauma, embodying the existential anxiety that characterized the post-war period and the broader cultural shift toward modernism's exploration of human vulnerability.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The work functions as both self-portrait and memento mori, with Munch depicting himself as a survivor of near-death experience. The domestic interior setting symbolizes the quarantine and isolation experienced during illness, while the visible medicine bottles and sick-room atmosphere serve as symbols of medical intervention and recovery. The artist's direct gaze confronts mortality while asserting survival. The painting's title explicitly connects personal experience with the global pandemic, making the work both intimate autobiography and universal commentary on human fragility during times of widespread disease.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Munch employs his characteristic expressionist techniques, using bold, loose brushstrokes and vivid colors to convey emotional intensity rather than realistic representation. The composition centers the figure against a simplified interior, creating psychological focus through asymmetrical balance. The color palette combines sickly greens and yellows with flesh tones, suggesting both illness and recovery. The painting's gestural quality and emphasis on emotional content over precise detail exemplifies expressionism's departure from naturalistic representation, using distortion and color symbolism to communicate internal states and psychological experience.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>While Munch's position as an established artist afforded him access to medical care and a comfortable recovery environment, the painting inadvertently highlights class disparities during the pandemic. His ability to document his illness experience through art contrasts sharply with the countless anonymous victims who lacked access to medical care or comfortable recovery spaces. The domestic setting depicted suggests middle-class comfort unavailable to working-class pandemic victims. The painting's existence itself represents privilege – the luxury of artistic reflection during recovery that was denied to those struggling for basic survival during the pandemic's economic devastation.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The Spanish flu, caused by the H1N1 influenza A virus, was an unusually deadly pandemic strain that differed significantly from seasonal influenza. The 1918 virus likely originated from an avian source and underwent genetic mutations that enabled efficient human-to-human transmission. Unlike typical influenza that primarily affects the very young and elderly, the 1918 strain caused severe illness and death among healthy adults aged 20-40, though Munch's age group also faced significant mortality risk. The virus spread rapidly through respiratory droplets, with global transportation facilitating its worldwide dissemination in just months.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Munch's self-portrait captures several visual indicators consistent with influenza recovery. His facial coloration suggests the pallor and fatigue associated with post-viral weakness. The presence of medicine bottles indicates ongoing treatment, while his seated position in indoor clothing suggests the weakness and need for rest characteristic of influenza convalescence. The Spanish flu typically presented with sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, muscle aches, and extreme fatigue. More severe cases developed pneumonia, with the distinctive blue discoloration of cyanosis. Munch's relatively alert appearance suggests he has passed through the acute phase but retains the exhaustion typical of recovery.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>In 1919, influenza treatment remained largely supportive, as antiviral medications and modern intensive care did not exist. Treatment focused on bed rest, hydration, and symptomatic relief through aspirin for fever and pain. The medicine bottles visible in Munch's painting likely contained such supportive treatments. Severe cases might receive oxygen therapy or treatment for secondary bacterial infections, though antibiotics had not yet been discovered. Many patients relied on folk remedies and patent medicines of questionable efficacy. Munch's apparent access to medical care and comfortable recovery environment would have been crucial factors in his survival and recovery.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The Spanish flu pandemic highlighted significant health disparities based on socioeconomic status, living conditions, and access to healthcare. Overcrowded urban areas and poor housing facilitated viral transmission, while malnutrition weakened immune responses among lower socioeconomic populations. Munch's recovery was facilitated by his financial stability, which enabled isolation, proper nutrition, medical care, and time for convalescence without economic pressure to return to work prematurely. His artistic documentation of the experience reflects the privilege of illness as a subject for contemplation rather than simply a threat to survival, illustrating how social class fundamentally shaped pandemic experiences.</p>
