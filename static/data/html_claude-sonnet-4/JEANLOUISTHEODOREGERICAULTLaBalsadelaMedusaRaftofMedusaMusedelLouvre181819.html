        <h1>The Raft of the Medusa (La Radeau de la Méduse)</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist</h2>
        <p>Théodore Géricault (1791-1824) was a pivotal French Romantic painter whose brief but influential career bridged Neoclassicism and Romanticism. Born into a wealthy Rouen family, Géricault studied under Carle Vernet and Pierre-Narcisse Guérin, developing a style that emphasized emotional intensity and dramatic realism. His fascination with contemporary events and human suffering culminated in this masterwork, which he completed at age 27, just five years before his premature death.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Painted between 1818-1819, "The Raft of the Medusa" emerged during the Bourbon Restoration following Napoleon's defeat. The work depicts the aftermath of the French naval frigate Méduse's 1816 shipwreck off Senegal's coast. The tragedy became a political scandal when it was revealed that the captain, appointed through political connections rather than merit, had abandoned ship with lifeboats reserved for aristocrats and officials, leaving 147 passengers and crew on a hastily constructed raft. Only 15 survived after 13 days of starvation, dehydration, and cannibalism. Géricault's decision to paint this controversial contemporary event challenged academic traditions favoring mythological or historical subjects, marking a revolutionary shift toward social realism.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The composition functions as both literal documentation and allegorical commentary on human nature and social injustice. The pyramid structure centers on the figure waving cloth toward the distant rescue ship Argus, symbolizing hope emerging from despair. The contrast between the dead and dying in the foreground and the animated survivors signals humanity's capacity for both destruction and resilience. The makeshift sail billowing against stormy skies represents the fragile boundary between civilization and chaos, while the diverse racial representation of survivors subtly critiques colonial hierarchies.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Géricault employed dramatic chiaroscuro lighting to create emotional intensity, with warm flesh tones contrasting against the cool gray-green palette of sea and sky. The monumental scale (16 × 23 feet) forces viewers into visceral engagement with the suffering. Dynamic diagonal compositions create movement and tension, while meticulous anatomical rendering demonstrates the artist's extensive preparation, including studying corpses at morgues and interviewing survivors. This synthesis of Romantic emotion with realistic observation established new standards for history painting.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting serves as a powerful indictment of class privilege and colonial exploitation. The original disaster resulted from nepotistic appointments that prioritized social connections over competence. Géricault deliberately included figures of different races among the survivors, challenging prevailing racial hierarchies and highlighting the shared humanity of all victims. The work implicitly critiques the expendability of common sailors and colonial subjects while exposing how political corruption translates into human suffering.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The survivors faced multiple life-threatening conditions resulting from prolonged exposure and deprivation. Dehydration occurred rapidly in the tropical climate, while starvation set in within days due to limited provisions. Exposure to saltwater and sun caused severe skin damage and electrolyte imbalances. The psychological trauma of witnessing death and resorting to cannibalism created additional stress responses that compromised immune function and rational decision-making.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Géricault's meticulous rendering reveals multiple pathological indicators: emaciated bodies showing muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss characteristic of severe malnutrition; pallid, grayish skin tones suggesting dehydration and circulatory compromise; hollow eye sockets indicating fluid loss; and listless postures reflecting extreme weakness. The artist's anatomical accuracy in depicting various stages of deterioration demonstrates understanding of how prolonged starvation systematically destroys bodily functions.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>The 15 survivors received immediate medical attention upon rescue, including gradual rehydration and careful refeeding to prevent refeeding syndrome. Contemporary medical knowledge was limited, but physicians understood the need for slow rehabilitation. Treatment would have included wound care for salt-water lesions, nutritional support, and what we would now recognize as psychological counseling for trauma survivors.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The tragedy exemplifies how social inequities directly impact health outcomes. Class privilege determined access to lifeboats and survival resources, while colonial subjects and lower-ranking crew members were disproportionately abandoned. Political appointments based on connections rather than competence created the conditions for disaster. The incident demonstrates how structural inequalities translate into differential morbidity and mortality rates during crises.</p>
