        <h1>Hubert Airy's Visual Documentation of Migraine Scotomas (1870)</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group</h2>
        <p>Hubert Airy (1838-1903) was a British physician and the son of renowned astronomer Sir George Biddell Airy. Unlike traditional artists, Airy approached visual documentation from a scientific perspective, combining his medical training with precise observational skills. His work represents an early example of medical illustration created by a practicing physician who experienced the phenomena he documented firsthand.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>This illustration was published in 1870 during the height of the Victorian era, a period marked by scientific advancement and systematic classification of medical phenomena. The Royal Society of London, where Airy presented his findings, represented the pinnacle of scientific discourse in Britain. This was an era when migraine was poorly understood, often dismissed as hysteria in women or attributed to moral failings. Airy's systematic documentation provided legitimacy to subjective visual experiences, contributing to the emerging field of neurology and challenging prevailing attitudes toward neurological conditions.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The crescent-shaped, fortified patterns in Airy's illustration carry profound symbolic meaning beyond their medical accuracy. The zigzag fortification patterns resemble medieval castle battlements, suggesting warfare between normal vision and pathological disruption. The progression from small, scattered forms to larger, more dramatic crescents symbolizes the temporal evolution of migraine aura. The stark contrast between light and dark areas represents the fundamental neurological principle of excitation and inhibition, while the geometric precision suggests the ordered, almost architectural nature of neurological phenomena.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Airy's illustration demonstrates masterful use of contrast, employing black, white, and crosshatched patterns to represent varying degrees of visual disturbance. The composition follows principles of scientific illustration, with multiple views arranged systematically to show progression over time. The use of negative space effectively communicates the concept of scotomas—areas of absent or diminished vision. The geometric precision and attention to detail reflect Victorian scientific illustration standards, while the dramatic tonal contrasts serve both aesthetic and functional purposes, making the pathological features immediately recognizable.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The publication of Airy's work in the prestigious Royal Society proceedings highlights significant social inequities of the Victorian era. As a male physician from an established scientific family, Airy had access to platforms denied to women and lower social classes who might have experienced identical symptoms. Many migraine sufferers, particularly women, were often dismissed or misdiagnosed with hysteria. Airy's documentation legitimized these experiences primarily because of his social standing and medical credentials, illustrating how scientific authority was intertwined with class and gender privilege in Victorian medicine.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Migraine with aura affects approximately 25-30% of migraine sufferers and involves complex neurological mechanisms. The condition results from cortical spreading depression—a wave of neuronal depolarization followed by suppression that propagates across the visual cortex at 2-6 mm/minute. This phenomenon causes the characteristic expanding scotomas that Airy documented. Modern understanding reveals that genetic predisposition, combined with various triggers including stress, hormonal changes, and environmental factors, contributes to migraine susceptibility.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Airy's illustration captures the classic features of migraine aura scotomas: the characteristic C-shaped or horseshoe configuration, the zigzag fortification spectrum appearance, and the temporal progression from small central disturbances to larger peripheral manifestations. The scintillating edges represent areas of neuronal hyperactivity, while the dark centers correspond to regions of neuronal suppression. These visual phenomena typically last 20-60 minutes and often precede the headache phase of migraine, serving as reliable diagnostic indicators.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>In Airy's era, treatment options were extremely limited, often consisting of rest, dietary modifications, and various ineffective remedies. Contemporary treatment approaches include prophylactic medications such as beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, and CGRP antagonists. Acute treatment may involve triptans, though these are contraindicated during aura phases. Non-pharmacological approaches include trigger identification and avoidance, stress management, and lifestyle modifications including regular sleep patterns and dietary considerations.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Migraine demonstrates significant social determinants, with higher prevalence among women (3:1 ratio), individuals with lower socioeconomic status, and those experiencing chronic stress. Access to appropriate diagnosis and treatment remains inequitable, with specialized neurological care often limited by geography, insurance coverage, and healthcare system capacity. The historical dismissal of migraine, particularly in women, continues to influence contemporary medical attitudes and research funding allocation.</p>
