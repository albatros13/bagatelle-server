        <h1>Scurvy: A Medical Tragedy of the Maritime Age</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This engraving represents the work of 19th-century European illustrators who specialized in medical and scientific documentation. These artists, often working anonymously for medical textbooks and educational materials, combined technical precision with dramatic storytelling to communicate the harsh realities of disease and suffering during the age of exploration.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Created during the 19th century, this illustration documents one of history's most devastating maritime diseases. Scurvy plagued sailors from the 15th through 18th centuries, during the Age of Exploration when European powers expanded across oceans. The disease was particularly prevalent during long sea voyages when ships carried limited provisions. By the time this engraving was created, the connection between scurvy and vitamin C deficiency had been established, making such images both historical documentation and medical education tools. The illustration reflects the growing scientific understanding of disease etiology during the Industrial Revolution period.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The cramped ship's quarters symbolize the confined, harsh conditions of maritime life. The scattered, weakened figures represent the democratic nature of scurvy—affecting sailors regardless of rank when vitamin C was absent. The wooden ship structure frames the scene like a coffin, symbolizing the mortality associated with the disease. The positioning of bodies suggests both physical weakness and social breakdown, as the normal hierarchies and activities of ship life collapse under the weight of collective illness.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Executed in the detailed cross-hatching technique characteristic of 19th-century medical illustration, the artwork employs strong contrasts between light and shadow to emphasize the severity of the condition. The composition uses diagonal lines created by the ship's wooden beams to guide the viewer's eye across the scene of suffering. The artist employs realistic proportions and anatomical accuracy to serve the illustration's educational purpose, while the crowded composition emphasizes the claustrophobic conditions aboard ship. The monochromatic palette reinforces the somber, clinical nature of the medical documentation.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This image reveals significant social inequalities of maritime culture. While officers often had access to better provisions and private quarters, common sailors were crowded into lower decks with minimal nutrition. The illustration suggests how disease affected the most vulnerable crew members disproportionately. Naval hierarchies meant that life-saving knowledge about preventing scurvy through citrus consumption was often restricted to educated officers, leaving common sailors vulnerable to nutritional diseases that were preventable with proper resources and knowledge distribution.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Scurvy results from severe vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency, typically occurring after 2-3 months without adequate intake. Humans cannot synthesize vitamin C and must obtain it through diet, primarily from fresh fruits and vegetables. The disease develops when collagen synthesis becomes impaired due to vitamin C deficiency, as ascorbic acid is essential for hydroxylation of proline and lysine in collagen formation. This leads to defective collagen throughout the body, affecting connective tissues, blood vessels, and wound healing.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The illustration depicts classic scurvy manifestations: prostrated figures suggesting profound weakness and fatigue, positioning that implies joint pain and muscle aches. Scurvy patients typically exhibit bleeding gums, tooth loss, poor wound healing, and petechial rashes. The hunched postures suggest bone pain and joint swelling. Advanced cases show reopening of old wounds, internal hemorrhaging, and eventually cardiovascular collapse. The scattered positioning of the figures suggests the debilitating weakness that prevents normal activity and social interaction.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>By the 18th century, citrus fruits were recognized as effective scurvy prevention and treatment. Fresh lemon or lime juice could reverse symptoms within days to weeks. The British Navy's adoption of citrus rations earned British sailors the nickname "limeys." Treatment required daily doses of vitamin C through fresh fruits, vegetables, or preserved citrus juice. Sauerkraut also proved effective during long voyages. Recovery was typically rapid once vitamin C was restored to the diet, with symptoms improving within a week of adequate supplementation.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Scurvy reflected broader social inequalities and economic constraints of maritime exploration. Poor provisioning systems, limited preservation technology, and prioritizing cargo space over crew nutrition created conditions for disease. Social class determined access to fresh provisions and medical knowledge. Economic pressures to maximize profit from voyages often meant minimal investment in crew health. Geographic isolation during long voyages prevented access to fresh foods, while naval hierarchies limited information sharing about disease prevention strategies.</p>
