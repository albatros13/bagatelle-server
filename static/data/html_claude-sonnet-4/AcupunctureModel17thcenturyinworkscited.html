        <h1>Acupuncture Model (17th century)</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This 17th-century acupuncture model represents the collective artisanship of Chinese medical practitioners and craftsmen during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) or early Qing Dynasty (1644-1912). These models were typically created by skilled artisans working in collaboration with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physicians, reflecting centuries of accumulated medical knowledge. The creation of such models was not attributed to individual artists but rather represented institutional medical knowledge preserved and transmitted through generations of practitioners.</p>
        
        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>The 17th century marked a significant period in Chinese medical history, coinciding with the consolidation of TCM principles and the systematization of acupuncture practices. During this era, China experienced cultural flourishing under the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, with increased emphasis on medical education and standardization. The creation of anatomical models served both educational and clinical purposes, reflecting the sophisticated understanding of human anatomy within Chinese medical tradition. This period also saw increased interaction with Western medical knowledge through Jesuit missionaries, creating a unique cultural intersection of medical philosophies.</p>
        
        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The bronze figure embodies the Chinese conceptualization of the human body as a microcosm of the universe, with meridian lines representing the flow of qi (vital energy) throughout the body. The precise mapping of acupuncture points symbolizes the harmony between heaven, earth, and humanity—fundamental concepts in Chinese philosophy. The model's upright posture and serene expression reflect the ideal state of health and spiritual balance. Each marked point carries symbolic significance, representing not merely anatomical locations but nodes of energetic transformation and healing potential.</p>
        
        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The model demonstrates remarkable artistic sophistication through its harmonious proportions and meticulous attention to anatomical detail. The bronze medium provides durability while allowing for precise engraving of meridian pathways and acupuncture points. The artist employed principles of symmetry and balance, reflecting Chinese aesthetic values and medical theory. The linear quality of the meridian markings creates rhythmic patterns across the figure's surface, while the three-dimensional form allows for comprehensive spatial understanding of point locations. The minimalist approach to facial features focuses attention on the functional aspects of the medical information.</p>
        
        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Access to such sophisticated medical models and the knowledge they represented was largely limited to educated male physicians and wealthy institutions. Women were generally excluded from formal medical education, despite their roles as healers in domestic settings. The cost of bronze models made them accessible primarily to imperial medical colleges and wealthy private practitioners, creating disparities in medical education quality. Rural populations relied on less sophisticated training methods, potentially affecting treatment quality and medical knowledge dissemination.</p>
        
        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>In traditional Chinese medicine, disease is conceptualized as an imbalance or blockage in the flow of qi through the body's meridian system. Rather than focusing on specific pathogens, TCM emphasizes disruptions in the body's energetic harmony caused by factors including emotional stress, environmental influences, dietary imbalances, and lifestyle factors. The acupuncture model represents a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for addressing these energetic imbalances through precise needle placement at specific points along meridian pathways.</p>
        
        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>TCM practitioners identified illness through complex diagnostic methods including pulse diagnosis, tongue examination, and observation of patient complexion and behavior. The acupuncture points marked on the model correspond to specific organ systems and energetic functions, allowing practitioners to identify patterns of disharmony. Signs of qi stagnation or deficiency were mapped to particular meridian pathways, with corresponding acupuncture points serving as both diagnostic indicators and therapeutic targets.</p>
        
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment involved the insertion of fine needles at specific acupuncture points to restore proper qi flow and energetic balance. The model served as a reference guide for precise point location, ensuring accurate needle placement. Treatment protocols varied based on individual patient constitution, seasonal factors, and specific symptom patterns. Practitioners also employed moxibustion (burning of mugwort herb) at designated points, herbal medicine, and dietary therapy as complementary treatments.</p>
        
        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Chinese medical theory recognized the influence of social factors on health, including occupational stress, social relationships, and emotional well-being. The model reflects an understanding that illness often resulted from social disruption, poverty, or emotional disturbance affecting the body's energetic balance. Access to acupuncture treatment was influenced by socioeconomic status, geographic location, and social connections, with wealthy urban populations having greater access to skilled practitioners and sophisticated medical knowledge.</p>
