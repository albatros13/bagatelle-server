        <h1>Oedipus and Antigone or The Plague of Thebes</h1>
        <h2>Charles François Jalabert</h2>

        <h3>Artist</h3>
        <p>Charles François Jalabert (1819-1901) was a French academic painter who epitomized the neoclassical tradition of the mid-19th century. Born in Nîmes, Jalabert studied under Paul Delaroche at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and won the Prix de Rome in 1845. He became known for his historical and mythological subjects, executed with meticulous attention to classical composition and draftsmanship that characterized the French academic system.</p>

        <h3>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h3>
        <p>Painted in 1842, this work emerged during the July Monarchy period in France, when neoclassical themes remained popular despite the growing influence of Romanticism. The painting reflects the 19th-century fascination with Greek tragedy and classical antiquity, serving both as entertainment and moral instruction. During this period, European artists frequently turned to ancient sources to explore contemporary social issues, including disease, political upheaval, and moral corruption. The choice of Sophocles' tragic narrative allowed Jalabert to examine themes of collective suffering and divine punishment that resonated with audiences experiencing rapid social and political change.</p>

        <h3>Symbolism and Iconography</h3>
        <p>The painting draws from Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex," depicting the moment when plague devastates Thebes as divine punishment for Oedipus's unwitting crimes. Antigone, shown in pink robes, guides her blind father through the plague-stricken city, symbolizing filial devotion and moral guidance. The architectural setting evokes ancient Thebes, while the suffering figures represent divine wrath manifested through disease. The juxtaposition of the noble central figures against the background of communal suffering emphasizes themes of tragic fate, moral responsibility, and the relationship between individual transgression and collective punishment.</p>

        <h3>Stylistic Significance</h3>
        <p>Jalabert employs classical compositional principles, organizing figures in a pyramidal structure centered on Oedipus and Antigone. The artist demonstrates mastery of academic drawing techniques through careful modeling of anatomy and drapery. His color palette combines warm earth tones with cooler architectural elements, creating visual harmony while directing attention to the central figures. The painting exhibits the linear precision and idealized forms characteristic of French academic art, emphasizing clarity and noble subject matter over emotional expressiveness. The balanced composition and restrained emotion reflect neoclassical values of order and moral instruction.</p>

        <h3>Social and Cultural Inequities</h3>
        <p>The painting reflects 19th-century European perspectives on ancient Greek society, potentially romanticizing slavery and social hierarchies present in classical antiquity. The work was created within the French academic system that excluded women and minorities from formal artistic training and recognition. Additionally, the idealized representation of ancient Greek culture may obscure the historical realities of social stratification and the marginalization of women, despite Antigone's prominent role in the narrative. The painting's exhibition in elite cultural institutions would have been accessible primarily to educated, wealthy audiences.</p>

        <h3>Description of Disease and Etiology</h3>
        <p>The plague of Thebes, as described in Sophocles' tragedy, represents a divine punishment rather than a specific medical condition. However, ancient plagues likely included diseases such as typhus, bubonic plague, or typhoid fever. These epidemic diseases typically spread through overcrowded urban conditions, poor sanitation, and contaminated water sources. The mythological framework attributes the plague's cause to moral transgression rather than natural factors, reflecting ancient understanding of disease as supernatural punishment for individual or collective wrongdoing.</p>

        <h3>Pathological Signs and Signifiers of Illness</h3>
        <p>Jalabert depicts various manifestations of plague through the suffering figures surrounding Oedipus and Antigone. The artist shows physical weakness, prostration, and despair among the afflicted population. Bodies lie collapsed or supported by others, indicating severe debilitation characteristic of epidemic disease. The general atmosphere of communal suffering and the presence of multiple affected individuals suggest the contagious nature of the affliction. The artist's representation focuses more on the emotional and spiritual dimensions of suffering rather than specific clinical symptoms.</p>

        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>In the mythological context, the plague's resolution requires addressing its spiritual cause rather than medical intervention. Sophocles' narrative suggests that only identifying and punishing the guilty party can end the divine punishment. This reflects ancient Greek understanding of disease as requiring religious or moral remedies rather than medical treatment. Historical plague treatments in ancient times would have included prayer, purification rituals, and limited herbal remedies, with little understanding of infectious disease mechanisms or effective therapeutic interventions.</p>

        <h3>Social Determinants of Illness</h3>
        <p>The plague narrative illustrates how individual actions can impact community health, reflecting ancient understanding of collective responsibility. Urban density in ancient Thebes would have facilitated disease transmission, while social hierarchies affected access to resources during health crises. The myth emphasizes moral and spiritual factors as primary determinants of community health, though historical plagues were influenced by factors including poverty, malnutrition, overcrowding, and inadequate sanitation systems that disproportionately affected lower social classes.</p>
