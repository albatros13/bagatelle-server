        <h1>Munch Self Portrait with Spanish Flu (1919)</h1>

        <h2>Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Edvard Munch (1863-1944), the Norwegian Expressionist painter, created this self-portrait during his recovery from the Spanish flu pandemic. Known for his psychologically charged works including "The Scream," Munch's artistic career was deeply influenced by personal encounters with illness, death, and mental anguish. His unique position as both artist and patient provides an intimate perspective on the pandemic experience that devastated Europe in 1918-1919.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context (time-frame)</h2>
        <p>Created in 1919, this work emerges from one of history's most devastating pandemics. The Spanish flu infected approximately one-third of the global population and killed an estimated 50-100 million people worldwide. Unlike typical seasonal influenza, this pandemic disproportionately affected healthy young adults aged 20-40. Europe, already weakened by World War I, faced additional devastation as the virus spread rapidly through crowded military camps and war-torn cities. Munch himself contracted the flu in late 1918 and spent months in convalescence, during which he created several works documenting his illness experience.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting presents a dual perspective - the bedridden invalid and the seated convalescent - symbolizing the journey from severe illness toward recovery. The thermometer visible in the composition serves as a medical instrument and symbol of fevered suffering. The yellow chair represents domestic comfort and stability contrasted against the vulnerability of the sickbed. The fragmented composition suggests the disorientation and psychological fracturing experienced during severe illness, while the warmer color palette in the background may indicate hope for recovery.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance (elements of art/ principles of design)</h2>
        <p>Munch employs his characteristic Expressionist style with bold, gestural brushstrokes and emotional color choices rather than naturalistic representation. The composition uses asymmetrical balance, with the horizontal figure contrasting the vertical seated form. The color palette shifts from the sickly greens and pale tones of the bedridden figure to warmer oranges and yellows, suggesting the progression from illness to health. The loose, energetic brushwork conveys the artist's emotional and physical state, while the simplified forms emphasize psychological over physical accuracy.</p>

        <h2>Social / Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>While Munch's privileged position as an established artist allowed him private medical care and the luxury of extended convalescence, millions of working-class individuals lacked such advantages. The pandemic revealed stark inequalities in healthcare access, living conditions, and economic security. Overcrowded tenements, poor nutrition, and inability to isolate contributed to higher mortality rates among lower socioeconomic classes. Munch's artistic documentation of illness represents a perspective unavailable to those who perished or lacked the means to record their experiences.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The 1918 influenza pandemic was caused by an H1N1 influenza A virus with genes of avian origin. Unlike typical seasonal flu, this strain triggered an excessive immune response called a "cytokine storm," particularly in healthy young adults with robust immune systems. The virus spread through respiratory droplets and was highly contagious, with a basic reproduction number estimated between 1.4-2.8. The pandemic occurred in multiple waves, with the deadliest wave occurring in fall 1918.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Munch's painting captures several clinical manifestations of influenza. The pallor and gaunt appearance of the bedridden figure suggests the severe debilitation common in Spanish flu patients. The presence of the thermometer indicates the high fever characteristic of the disease, often reaching 104°F (40°C). The positioning suggests the profound weakness and fatigue that accompanied the illness. The psychological fragmentation depicted may reference the delirium and neurological complications some patients experienced, including encephalitis lethargica.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>In 1919, treatment options were severely limited. No antiviral medications, antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections, or mechanical ventilation existed. Treatment consisted primarily of supportive care: bed rest, hydration, fever reduction with aspirin (though high doses may have contributed to mortality), and isolation. Some physicians attempted treatments with oxygen, stimulants, or experimental serums, but these had limited efficacy. Recovery depended largely on the patient's immune system and overall health status prior to infection.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The Spanish flu's impact was shaped by numerous social determinants. Wartime conditions, including malnutrition, stress, and overcrowding, increased susceptibility. Urban density facilitated transmission, while rural areas often experienced delayed but severe outbreaks. Economic inequality affected access to healthcare and ability to isolate. Age and pre-existing health conditions influenced outcomes, though this pandemic uniquely affected healthy young adults. Cultural practices around caregiving, often performed by women, increased their exposure risk.</p>
