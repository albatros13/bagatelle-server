        <h1>Michelangelo's Pietà: A Masterpiece of Renaissance Art and Human Suffering</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) created this iconic Pietà between 1498-1499 when he was only 24 years old. This marble sculpture, housed in St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, represents one of the most celebrated works of Renaissance art. Michelangelo, born in Caprese, Italy, was a master sculptor, painter, architect, and poet who became one of the most influential artists in Western art history.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>The Pietà was commissioned during the High Renaissance period, specifically at the end of the 15th century, when Italy was experiencing a cultural rebirth that emphasized humanism, classical antiquity, and religious devotion. This work was created during a time when the Catholic Church held immense power and influence over European society. The Renaissance witnessed a renewed interest in human anatomy, classical sculpture techniques, and the fusion of Christian theology with humanistic ideals. The sculpture reflects the period's fascination with both divine spirituality and human emotion, embodying the Renaissance belief that art could serve as a bridge between the earthly and the divine.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The Pietà depicts the Virgin Mary holding the dead body of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion, representing the ultimate maternal sacrifice and divine love. Mary's youthful appearance, despite her son's adult age, symbolizes her eternal purity and divine nature. The composition embodies themes of death, resurrection, maternal love, and redemption. The pyramidal arrangement of the figures creates a sense of stability and eternal peace, while Mary's serene expression suggests acceptance of divine will rather than earthly grief. The draped fabric and positioning of Christ's body evoke both vulnerability and dignity in death.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo's mastery is evident in the sculpture's perfect balance of realism and idealization. The artist employed contrapposto positioning and anatomically precise detail, demonstrating his extensive study of human cadavers. The smooth, polished marble surface creates an almost luminous quality that enhances the spiritual atmosphere. The composition follows classical principles of proportion and harmony, while the flowing drapery demonstrates technical virtuosity. The pyramidal structure provides visual stability, and the interplay of light and shadow across the carved surfaces creates dramatic emotional impact. Michelangelo's ability to convey both physical weight and spiritual transcendence showcases Renaissance artistic ideals.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The Pietà was commissioned by French cardinal Jean de Bilhères, reflecting the wealth disparity between Church hierarchy and common believers. During this period, artistic patronage was limited to the wealthy elite, particularly Church officials and nobility, while the majority of the population lived in poverty and had no access to such magnificent art. The sculpture's location in St. Peter's Basilica made it accessible primarily to pilgrims who could afford to travel to Rome, excluding many lower-class believers from experiencing this spiritual masterpiece directly.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The artwork depicts the aftermath of crucifixion, a form of execution that caused death through multiple physiological mechanisms. Crucifixion typically resulted in death by asphyxiation, hypovolemic shock, or cardiac arrest. The process involved severe trauma, blood loss, dehydration, and respiratory compromise. Prior to crucifixion, victims endured scourging, which caused significant tissue damage and blood loss, weakening the body's ability to survive the subsequent torture.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Michelangelo's sculpture shows Christ's body in a state of rigor mortis, with characteristic pallor and limpness. The positioning suggests the muscle relaxation that occurs after death, and the anatomically correct representation of the lifeless form demonstrates the artist's understanding of post-mortem changes. The wounds from crucifixion, while subtle in this idealized representation, would have included puncture wounds in the hands and feet, along with tissue damage from the crown of thorns and scourging.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>In the historical context of crucifixion, no medical treatment was available or intended, as this was a method of execution. However, the Gospel accounts describe Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus preparing Christ's body with spices and linen wrappings according to Jewish burial customs. The Pietà represents the moment before this preparation, showing Mary's final intimate moment with her son's body.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The crucifixion depicted in the Pietà resulted from political and religious tensions in first-century Palestine under Roman occupation. Social determinants included religious persecution, political oppression, and the use of public execution as a tool of social control. The artwork reflects how political powerlessness, religious dissent, and social marginalization could lead to violent persecution and death in ancient societies.</p>
