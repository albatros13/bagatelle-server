        <h1>Traditional Chinese Medical Illustration: Jingmai Acupuncture Points (circa 100 BC)</h1>

        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>This acupuncture illustration represents the collaborative work of traditional Chinese medical practitioners and scholarly scribes during the Han Dynasty period. Rather than being attributed to a single artist, these medical diagrams were typically created by court physicians, medical scholars, and skilled calligraphers working within imperial medical institutions. The systematic documentation of acupuncture points reflects the collective knowledge of generations of Chinese medical practitioners who developed and refined Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theories and practices.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Created during the Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD), this illustration emerges from a pivotal period in Chinese medical history when systematic documentation of medical knowledge was being formalized. The circa 100 BC timeframe coincides with the compilation of foundational medical texts such as the Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine). This period marked the transition from purely oral medical traditions to written documentation, reflecting broader Han Dynasty emphasis on scholarly systematization and imperial standardization of knowledge. The creation of such detailed anatomical charts demonstrates the sophisticated understanding of human physiology within Chinese medical philosophy.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The illustration employs rich symbolic elements fundamental to TCM philosophy. The human figure serves as a microcosm reflecting macrocosmic principles of balance and harmony. The interconnected lines represent the meridian system (jingmai), symbolizing the flow of qi (vital energy) throughout the body. The precise placement of textual annotations in Chinese characters indicates specific acupuncture points, each carrying symbolic significance related to organ systems and energetic functions. The vertical composition suggests the connection between earth and heaven, fundamental to Chinese cosmological thinking, while the systematic labeling reflects the Confucian emphasis on order and categorization.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The illustration demonstrates classical Chinese artistic principles emphasizing clarity and functional beauty. The line work is deliberate and precise, utilizing varying weights to distinguish between anatomical boundaries and meridian pathways. The composition employs asymmetrical balance, with the human figure positioned slightly off-center while maintaining visual equilibrium through strategic text placement. The monochromatic palette reflects traditional Chinese ink painting techniques, emphasizing form and content over decorative elements. The integration of calligraphic text with anatomical illustration represents a unique fusion of linguistic and visual communication characteristic of Chinese scholarly traditions.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>Access to formal medical knowledge and treatment represented during this period was heavily stratified by social class. Such detailed medical illustrations were primarily available to court physicians, wealthy scholars, and imperial medical institutions, creating significant healthcare disparities between elite and common populations. Rural communities often relied on folk practitioners with limited access to systematized medical knowledge. Gender inequities were also pronounced, as formal medical education was largely restricted to male scholars, despite women's traditional roles as healers and midwives in many communities.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Traditional Chinese Medicine conceptualizes disease as disruption in the harmonious flow of qi through the meridian system illustrated in this diagram. Rather than focusing on specific pathological conditions, TCM emphasizes imbalances between yin and yang energies, blockages in meridian pathways, and disharmony between organ systems (zang-fu). Etiology in TCM encompasses external factors (wind, cold, heat, dampness), internal factors (emotions, stress), and lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, sexual activity). The acupuncture points shown serve as access portals to redirect and rebalance these energetic flows.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>TCM diagnosis relies on observable signs including pulse quality, tongue appearance, complexion, and palpation of specific acupuncture points depicted in the illustration. Practitioners assess qi flow patterns through careful examination of meridian pathways, identifying areas of excess, deficiency, or stagnation. Physical symptoms are interpreted within broader patterns of disharmony rather than isolated pathological entities. The systematic mapping of acupuncture points enables practitioners to identify specific areas where energetic imbalances manifest as physical symptoms or emotional disturbances.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Treatment involves needle insertion at specific acupuncture points illustrated in the diagram to restore proper qi circulation and energetic balance. Practitioners select point combinations based on individual patient presentations and underlying pattern diagnoses. Treatment protocols often integrate acupuncture with herbal medicine, dietary therapy, and lifestyle modifications. The systematic documentation of point locations and functions enabled standardization of treatment approaches while maintaining flexibility for individualized therapeutic strategies.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>TCM recognizes social and environmental factors as fundamental determinants of health and illness. Economic stress, social isolation, occupational hazards, and political upheaval are understood to disrupt energetic balance and contribute to disease development. The imperial medical system acknowledged connections between social harmony and individual health, reflecting broader Chinese philosophical emphasis on interconnectedness between personal and societal well-being. Access to proper nutrition, adequate housing, and social support networks were recognized as essential elements of health maintenance.</p>
