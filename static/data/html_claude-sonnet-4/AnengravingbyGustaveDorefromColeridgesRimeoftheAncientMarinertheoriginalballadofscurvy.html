        <h1>Gustave Doré's Engraving from "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"</h1>

        <h2>Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Paul Gustave Doré (1832-1883) was a French artist, printmaker, and illustrator who became one of the most celebrated engravers of the 19th century. Known for his dramatic and fantastical illustrations, Doré created visual interpretations for numerous literary classics including Dante's Divine Comedy, the Bible, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner." His distinctive style combined romantic sensibilities with meticulous technical precision in wood engraving and etching.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>This engraving was created during the mid-19th century (circa 1876) as part of Doré's illustrations for Coleridge's famous 1798 poem. The work emerged during the height of European maritime exploration and colonial expansion, when long sea voyages were common but fraught with medical dangers. Scurvy was a well-documented scourge of sailors, and by Doré's time, the connection between the disease and nutritional deficiency was becoming understood following James Lind's experiments in the 1740s and Captain Cook's successful prevention methods. The illustration reflects the Romantic movement's fascination with human suffering, supernatural themes, and the sublime terror of nature.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The engraving depicts the cursed mariners aboard their ghost ship, with the albatross—symbol of the mariner's transgression against nature—prominently featured. The huddled, emaciated figures represent not only the physical ravages of scurvy but also spiritual punishment for ecological sin. The ship's rigging creates a web-like prison, symbolizing entrapment and doom. The positioning of the sailors, some supporting others, illustrates the communal suffering while highlighting individual mortality. The albatross serves as both burden and witness to their deterioration, embodying the intersection of natural consequence and supernatural retribution.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Doré employs masterful chiaroscuro through cross-hatching techniques, creating dramatic contrasts between light and shadow that emphasize the gothic atmosphere. The composition uses diagonal lines in the ship's rigging to create dynamic tension and guide the viewer's eye through the scene. The vertical emphasis of the masts contrasts with the horizontal grouping of the afflicted sailors, creating visual hierarchy. Doré's precise linework captures both the mechanical details of the ship and the organic deterioration of human forms, demonstrating his technical virtuosity in wood engraving while serving the narrative's emotional intensity.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The image reflects the class disparities inherent in maritime culture, where common sailors bore the greatest health risks during long voyages while officers often had access to better provisions. The democratic nature of scurvy's affliction—affecting all crew members regardless of rank—serves as a leveling force, though the reality was that lower-class sailors typically suffered more severe malnutrition. The engraving implicitly critiques the expendability of working-class sailors in the service of maritime commerce and imperial expansion, themes resonant with 19th-century social reform movements.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Scurvy is a disease caused by severe vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency. Humans cannot synthesize vitamin C and must obtain it through dietary sources, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. During long sea voyages, sailors subsisted on preserved foods—salt pork, hardtack, and dried goods—that contained no vitamin C. The disease typically manifests after 1-3 months of vitamin C deprivation, as the body's stores become depleted. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis, and its absence leads to the breakdown of connective tissues throughout the body.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Doré's figures exhibit classic scurvy symptomatology: emaciated frames suggesting muscle wasting, hunched postures indicating joint pain and weakness, and the general appearance of debilitation. The disease manifests through bleeding gums, tooth loss, skin hemorrhages, joint swelling, and delayed wound healing. Advanced cases show muscle weakness, bone pain, and internal bleeding. The sailors' gaunt faces and frail bodies accurately represent the cachexia associated with chronic nutritional deficiency, while their inability to maintain upright positions reflects the profound fatigue and musculoskeletal pain characteristic of scurvy.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>By the time of Doré's illustration, effective scurvy prevention was known through the work of James Lind and subsequent naval reforms. Treatment required immediate administration of fresh citrus fruits, vegetables, or other vitamin C sources. The British Royal Navy had implemented daily lime juice rations (hence "limeys"), and ships began carrying sauerkraut, sprouted grains, and preserved citrus. However, treatment effectiveness depended on the stage of disease progression and availability of fresh provisions, often impossible during extended voyages or polar expeditions.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Scurvy prevalence was directly tied to social and economic factors: maritime trade demands, inadequate provision planning, class-based food distribution aboard ships, and limited understanding of nutritional science. Working-class sailors had little agency in their dietary circumstances, dependent entirely on ship provisions determined by profit margins and storage limitations. Geographic isolation during voyages, seasonal availability of fresh foods, and the economic priorities of shipping companies over crew welfare created perfect conditions for scurvy outbreaks, making it fundamentally a disease of social and economic inequality.</p>
