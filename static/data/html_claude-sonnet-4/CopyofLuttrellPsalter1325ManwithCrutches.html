        <h1>Luttrell Psalter: Man with Crutches (1325)</h1>

        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The Luttrell Psalter was created by anonymous scribes and illuminators working in the East Anglian tradition, likely in a monastic scriptorium or under the patronage of Sir Geoffrey Luttrell of Irnham, Lincolnshire. This manuscript represents the collaborative work of medieval craftsmen specializing in illuminated manuscripts, combining religious devotion with detailed observations of contemporary life. The artists were likely monks or professional scribes trained in the Gothic manuscript tradition prevalent in 14th-century England.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Created in 1325, this illumination emerged during a period of significant social and economic transformation in medieval England. The early 14th century witnessed the aftermath of the Great Famine (1315-1322), population pressures, and increasing urbanization. This era preceded the Black Death by approximately twenty years, representing a time when physical disabilities and ailments were becoming more visible in artistic representations. The inclusion of disabled individuals in religious manuscripts reflected both the Christian emphasis on charity and the reality of medieval life where physical impairments were commonplace due to poor nutrition, accidents, warfare, and limited medical knowledge.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The depiction of the man with crutches carries profound religious symbolism within the psalter context. Crutches often symbolized human frailty and dependence on divine grace, echoing biblical themes of healing and spiritual transformation. The figure may represent the lame man healed by Christ or symbolize humanity's spiritual infirmity requiring divine intervention. The positioning of this figure alongside other characters suggests themes of pilgrimage, charity, and the Christian duty to care for the afflicted. The architectural elements and the presence of multiple figures create a narrative tableau emphasizing community and social responsibility.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The illumination demonstrates characteristic Gothic manuscript style with vibrant pigments, particularly the rich blues and earth tones typical of 14th-century English illumination. The composition employs hierarchical scaling and demonstrates attention to realistic detail in depicting the crutches and the figure's posture. The linear quality of the drawing, combined with flat color application, creates visual clarity while maintaining decorative appeal. The artists employed symbolic color coding, with the disabled figure's clothing potentially indicating social status or spiritual condition. The marginal placement of the scene reflects the medieval practice of incorporating everyday observations into sacred texts.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The representation reveals significant social stratification in medieval society regarding disability and poverty. Disabled individuals often occupied marginal positions, dependent on charity and religious institutions for survival. The artistic placement of the disabled figure may reflect societal attitudes that simultaneously acknowledged Christian obligations toward the afflicted while maintaining their peripheral social status. Access to medical care was largely determined by social class, with peasants and the poor relying primarily on folk remedies and religious healing, while nobility could afford trained physicians.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The figure's use of crutches suggests lower limb impairment, which could result from various conditions prevalent in medieval times. Possible etiologies include congenital deformities, traumatic injuries from agricultural accidents or warfare, infectious diseases such as osteomyelitis, or nutritional deficiencies leading to conditions like rickets. The Great Famine's aftermath would have increased susceptibility to bone and joint disorders due to malnutrition during crucial developmental periods.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The illumination depicts the characteristic compensatory posture of individuals with lower limb impairment, showing reliance on wooden crutches for mobility. The figure's stance and positioning suggest possible weakness or paralysis of one or both lower extremities. The artist's attention to the realistic depiction of assistive devices indicates familiarity with such conditions, suggesting their commonality in medieval society. The body positioning implies adaptation to chronic disability rather than acute illness.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Medieval treatment for such conditions was extremely limited, consisting primarily of wooden crutches or walking aids crafted by local carpenters. Medical intervention might include herbal remedies, prayer, pilgrimage to healing shrines, and occasionally crude surgical procedures. Monastic infirmaries provided basic care, while folk healers offered traditional remedies. The primary "treatment" was often resignation to the condition and reliance on community support and religious charity for survival.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The prevalence of disability in medieval society directly correlated with poverty, malnutrition, dangerous occupational conditions, and limited access to medical care. Poor sanitation, inadequate nutrition, and hazardous living conditions increased susceptibility to injuries and infections. Social class determined access to care, with disabled peasants often becoming dependent on alms and religious charity. The feudal system provided minimal social safety nets, making disability a pathway to marginalization and poverty.</p>
