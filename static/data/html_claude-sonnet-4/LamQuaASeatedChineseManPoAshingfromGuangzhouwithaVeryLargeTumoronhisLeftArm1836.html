        <h1>A Seated Chinese Man Po Ashing from Guangzhou with a Very Large Tumor on his Left Arm (1836)</h1>

        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Lam Qua (1801-1860), born Guan Qiaochang, was a pioneering Chinese painter who became one of the first Chinese artists to master Western oil painting techniques. Working primarily in Guangzhou (Canton), Lam Qua established himself as a prominent portraitist during the early 19th century, serving both Chinese and Western clientele. He was particularly renowned for his medical paintings, created in collaboration with American missionary surgeon Dr. Peter Parker, documenting various pathological conditions for medical education and research purposes.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>This painting was created in 1836 during the Qing Dynasty, a period when China maintained strict trade restrictions with Western nations through the Canton System. Guangzhou served as the sole port for foreign trade, creating a unique cultural intersection where East met West. The collaboration between Lam Qua and Dr. Peter Parker represented an unprecedented fusion of Chinese artistic tradition with Western medical science. Dr. Parker had established the first Western-style hospital in China in 1835, treating patients regardless of their ability to pay, which was revolutionary in a society where medical care was often limited by social class and economic status.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting functions as both medical documentation and humanistic portraiture. The subject's dignified pose and direct gaze assert his humanity despite his affliction, challenging contemporary Western stereotypes of Chinese people as exotic curiosities. The traditional Chinese clothing and hairstyle serve as cultural identifiers, while the neutral background focuses attention on the medical condition. The positioning of the tumor creates a visual tension between normalcy and pathology, representing the intersection of human dignity and medical inquiry.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Lam Qua's technique demonstrates a masterful synthesis of Western realism with Chinese artistic sensibilities. The precise anatomical rendering of the tumor reflects Western medical illustration traditions, while the subtle modeling of facial features and the balanced composition echo Chinese portraiture conventions. The artist's use of chiaroscuro creates dimensional depth, particularly in rendering the tumor's mass and texture. The color palette is restrained yet warm, emphasizing flesh tones that highlight both the subject's humanity and the pathological condition with equal clarity and respect.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The painting reflects significant social disparities of 19th-century China, where access to medical care was largely determined by economic status and geographic location. Po Ashing's willingness to be painted suggests his desperate need for treatment, likely after exhausting traditional Chinese medical options. The collaboration between Chinese artist and American surgeon highlights the complex power dynamics between colonizer and colonized, where Western medical knowledge was both genuinely beneficial and culturally invasive. The documentation process itself raises questions about consent and exploitation in medical photography of marginalized populations.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The massive growth on the patient's left arm appears consistent with a soft tissue sarcoma or possibly a large lipoma. Soft tissue sarcomas arise from mesenchymal tissues including fat, muscle, blood vessels, or connective tissue. The etiology of such tumors in the 19th century was poorly understood, though we now know they can result from genetic mutations, radiation exposure, chemical carcinogens, or viral infections. The tumor's size suggests a slow-growing benign lesion or a low-grade malignancy that had developed over many years without intervention.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The painting reveals several pathological indicators: the enormous size of the growth, its smooth, rounded appearance suggesting encapsulation, and the visible surface irregularities that may indicate ulceration or necrosis. The tumor appears to arise from the upper arm and extends significantly, likely causing functional impairment and possible vascular compromise. The patient's overall appearance suggests general good health otherwise, indicated by normal body habitus and alert facial expression, suggesting the growth may be benign despite its impressive size.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>In 1836, surgical options were limited by the absence of anesthesia and antiseptic techniques. Dr. Parker likely would have attempted surgical excision using basic instruments, with the patient enduring the procedure conscious or with minimal opium-based pain relief. The primary risks included hemorrhage, infection, and shock. Success depended on the tumor's location relative to major vessels and nerves. Traditional Chinese medicine might have attempted herbal treatments or acupuncture, though such large masses typically required surgical intervention for any hope of cure.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Po Ashing's condition reflects broader social determinants affecting health outcomes in 19th-century China. Limited access to early medical intervention allowed the tumor to reach massive proportions. Poverty likely prevented earlier treatment seeking, while cultural barriers may have delayed acceptance of Western surgical methods. Geographic isolation from major medical centers, combined with the stigma often associated with visible deformities in Chinese society, would have created additional barriers to care. The patient's eventual treatment by Dr. Parker represented a convergence of missionary medicine, cultural bridge-building, and humanitarian healthcare delivery.</p>
