        <h1>Francisco Goya - Beggars Who Get about on Their Own in Bordeaux (1824-1827)</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/ Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes (1746-1828) was a Spanish romantic painter and printmaker who became one of the most important artists of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Known for his evolution from court painter to social critic, Goya's later works increasingly focused on human suffering, disability, and social marginalization. This drawing was created during his final years of exile in Bordeaux, France, where he lived from 1824 until his death.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Created between 1824-1827, this work emerged during Goya's self-imposed exile in Bordeaux following the restoration of the absolutist monarchy under Ferdinand VII. Post-Napoleonic Spain was characterized by political repression, economic devastation, and widespread poverty. The aftermath of the Peninsular War (1808-1814) left many disabled veterans and displaced civilians struggling for survival. Begging was a visible consequence of social upheaval, while medical understanding of physical disabilities remained rudimentary. The Industrial Revolution was beginning to reshape European society, yet traditional charitable systems were inadequate for addressing mass poverty and disability.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and/or Iconography</h2>
        <p>The wheeled platform serves as both literal mobility device and metaphorical vessel of human resilience. The figure's self-propulsion symbolizes dignity amid dependency, challenging conventional notions of helplessness associated with disability. The beggar's weathered appearance and tattered clothing represent the broader social casualties of war and political instability. Goya's choice to depict "those who get about on their own" emphasizes agency and self-determination, contrasting with typical representations of disability as purely pitiable or burdensome.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Executed in Goya's characteristic loose, expressive drawing style, the work employs minimal linear elements to maximum emotional effect. The composition centers the figure dynamically, with the wheels creating visual movement across the picture plane. Goya's use of light and shadow emphasizes the subject's humanity while the sketch-like quality suggests immediacy and direct observation. The economy of line demonstrates mature artistic confidence, where every mark contributes to psychological depth rather than mere illustration.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>The drawing exposes the abandonment of disabled individuals by inadequate social support systems. In early 19th-century Europe, disability often meant economic ruin and social invisibility. Religious charity provided minimal relief, while state welfare was virtually nonexistent. The image critiques a society that produces disabled individuals through war and violence yet fails to provide adequate care or integration. Class distinctions are evident in the subject's obvious poverty, highlighting how disability intersects with economic disadvantage to create compound marginalization.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The figure appears to have lower limb paralysis or amputation, conditions frequently resulting from war injuries, infectious diseases, or congenital disorders. Given the historical context, probable causes include battlefield trauma, gangrene requiring amputation, poliomyelitis, spinal cord injury, or complications from diseases like tuberculosis affecting the spine. The era's limited understanding of infection control and surgical techniques meant that many injuries resulted in permanent disability or death.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The subject's reliance on a wheeled platform indicates complete loss of lower limb function. The positioning suggests possible leg amputation or paralysis, with the upper body compensating through arm strength for mobility. The figure's general frailty and aged appearance may indicate chronic malnutrition or systemic illness common among the impoverished disabled population. The makeshift nature of the mobility device reflects limited access to proper medical equipment or prosthetics.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Medical treatment options in the 1820s were severely limited. Amputation was performed without anesthesia using crude instruments, with survival rates depending on the patient's constitution and luck in avoiding infection. No rehabilitation services existed, leaving individuals to devise their own adaptive strategies. Pain management relied on alcohol or opium derivatives when available. The wheeled platform represents adaptive technology created by necessity rather than medical prescription, demonstrating remarkable ingenuity in the absence of professional intervention.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The subject's condition reflects multiple social determinants including poverty, lack of access to healthcare, inadequate nutrition, and social exclusion. War's disproportionate impact on lower socioeconomic classes meant greater exposure to injury and fewer resources for recovery. Urban environments offered some opportunities for subsistence through begging, while rural areas provided little support for disabled individuals. Gender, age, and social class further determined survival prospects and community acceptance.</p>
