        <h1>TB in Harlem by Alice Neel (1940)</h1>

        <h2>Artist</h2>
        <p>Alice Neel (1900-1984) was an American figurative painter renowned for her psychologically penetrating portraits and social realist works. Born in Pennsylvania, Neel developed a distinctive expressionist style that combined emotional intensity with social commentary. Throughout her career, she documented the human condition with unflinching honesty, particularly focusing on marginalized communities and social issues that were often overlooked by mainstream art establishments.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Created in 1940, "TB in Harlem" emerges from the Great Depression era when tuberculosis was ravaging urban communities, particularly affecting African American populations in overcrowded neighborhoods like Harlem. This period marked the height of the Harlem Renaissance's aftermath, where cultural flourishing coexisted with persistent health and economic disparities. Neel painted this work during her time living in Spanish Harlem, where she witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of tuberculosis on the community. The 1940s represented a critical moment in American public health, as tuberculosis remained a leading cause of death, disproportionately affecting poor and minority populations who lacked access to adequate healthcare and lived in substandard housing conditions.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The painting's iconography draws heavily from traditional representations of illness and suffering, while simultaneously challenging conventional artistic approaches to disease depiction. The figure's positioning evokes classical representations of martyrdom and sacrifice, while the urban setting grounds the work in contemporary social reality. The contrast between the figure's dignity and vulnerability creates a powerful commentary on how disease strips away social pretenses while revealing fundamental humanity. The domestic setting symbolizes both sanctuary and confinement, reflecting how tuberculosis patients were often isolated within their homes due to the disease's contagious nature and social stigma.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>Neel employs bold, expressive brushstrokes and a muted earth-tone palette punctuated by strategic color accents that emphasize the subject's psychological state. The composition utilizes asymmetrical balance, with the figure's placement creating visual tension that mirrors the emotional weight of the subject matter. The artist's characteristic distortion of form serves to heighten emotional impact rather than pursue realistic representation. Light and shadow play crucial roles, with harsh contrasts emphasizing the gaunt features and physical deterioration associated with tuberculosis. The painting's scale creates intimacy between viewer and subject, forcing confrontation with the reality of disease and social inequality.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>This work starkly illuminates the racial and economic inequalities that made tuberculosis a disease of the poor and marginalized. During the 1940s, African Americans in Harlem faced systematic discrimination in housing, healthcare, and employment, creating conditions that fostered tuberculosis transmission. Overcrowded tenements, poor ventilation, malnutrition, and limited access to medical care created a perfect storm for disease proliferation. Neel's painting serves as both documentation and indictment of these social determinants of health, challenging viewers to confront the intersection of poverty, racism, and disease.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs but capable of spreading to other organs. The bacteria spread through airborne droplets when infected individuals cough, sneeze, or speak. In the 1940s, tuberculosis was often called "consumption" due to how the disease seemed to consume patients from within, causing dramatic weight loss, weakness, and eventual death if untreated. The disease thrives in conditions of poverty, malnutrition, and overcrowding—circumstances that were prevalent in Harlem during this period.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>Neel masterfully incorporates clinical signs of tuberculosis into her artistic representation. The subject's gaunt appearance, hollow cheeks, and visible weight loss reflect the wasting syndrome characteristic of advanced tuberculosis. The pallor and yellowish skin tone suggest the chronic illness and possible fever associated with the disease. The figure's posture and facial expression convey the fatigue and malaise that accompany tuberculosis progression. The artist's emphasis on the chest area may allude to the respiratory symptoms central to pulmonary tuberculosis, including the persistent cough and chest pain that define the disease experience.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>In 1940, treatment options for tuberculosis were extremely limited and largely ineffective. The primary interventions included bed rest, fresh air therapy, and nutritional support—treatments that were often inaccessible to Harlem's poor residents. Sanatorium care, which isolated patients in institutions with controlled environments, was the standard treatment but was racially segregated and often unavailable to African Americans. Surgical interventions like pneumothorax therapy were attempted but carried significant risks. The revolutionary antibiotic streptomycin wouldn't be discovered until 1943, and effective combination chemotherapy didn't emerge until the 1950s, making tuberculosis largely a death sentence for many patients during this period.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>The painting powerfully illustrates how social determinants of health—including housing quality, income inequality, racial discrimination, and healthcare access—directly contributed to tuberculosis prevalence in Harlem. Overcrowded living conditions facilitated disease transmission, while poor nutrition weakened immune systems. Racial segregation limited access to quality healthcare facilities, and economic inequality prevented families from affording proper treatment. Environmental factors such as poor ventilation, inadequate heating, and substandard housing conditions created ideal circumstances for tuberculosis spread. Neel's work serves as a visual testament to how structural racism and economic inequality literally embodied themselves as disease in marginalized communities.</p>
