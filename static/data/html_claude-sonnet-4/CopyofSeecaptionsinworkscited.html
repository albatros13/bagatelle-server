        <h1>Medical Depictions in European Art: Neurofibromatosis and Erythromelangiastic Rosacea</h1>
        
        <h2>Artist/Group/Tribe</h2>
        <p>The left illustration depicting "La Lepre et Elephantiasis" represents the work of an unnamed European medical illustrator, likely working within the tradition of scientific documentation common in 16th-17th century medical texts. The portrait on the right, "Sir Francis Drake," is attributed to an English court painter from 1581, housed in the National Portrait Gallery, London. These works exemplify the intersection of medical observation and artistic representation during the early modern period.</p>

        <h2>Historical and Socio-Cultural Context</h2>
        <p>Both images originate from the late 16th century, a period marked by significant developments in medical knowledge and artistic documentation. The medical illustration reflects the era's attempt to categorize and understand various physical conditions through visual means, often conflating different diseases under broad diagnostic umbrellas. Sir Francis Drake's portrait, painted in 1581, captures England's maritime expansion period, when global exploration brought increased awareness of diverse medical conditions. This era preceded modern dermatological understanding, leading to misidentification of conditions like neurofibromatosis as "elephantiasis" or leprosy.</p>

        <h2>Symbolism and Iconography</h2>
        <p>The medical illustration employs stark, clinical representation to document physical abnormalities, serving both educational and cautionary purposes. The figures are depicted with dignity despite their conditions, suggesting a humanistic approach to medical documentation. Drake's portrait incorporates traditional symbols of nobility and maritime power—elaborate ruffs, rich fabrics, and confident posture—while simultaneously documenting what appears to be a dermatological condition. The juxtaposition reveals how social status could influence the artistic treatment of medical conditions.</p>

        <h2>Stylistic Significance</h2>
        <p>The medical illustration demonstrates careful attention to anatomical detail and proportional accuracy, employing linear clarity characteristic of scientific documentation. The neutral background focuses attention on the subjects' physical conditions. Drake's portrait employs the formal conventions of Tudor court portraiture—three-quarter view, rich color palette dominated by reds and blacks, and meticulous attention to textile details. The contrast between the clinical objectivity of the medical illustration and the dignified formality of the portrait reflects different artistic purposes and social contexts.</p>

        <h2>Social/Cultural Inequities</h2>
        <p>These images highlight significant disparities in how medical conditions were perceived and documented based on social class. While the anonymous subjects in the medical illustration are presented primarily as clinical specimens for study, Drake's condition is subtly integrated into a portrait celebrating his achievements and status. This disparity reflects broader societal attitudes toward disability and illness, where social position determined whether one's medical condition became a defining characteristic or merely a biographical detail.</p>

        <h2>Description of Disease & Etiology</h2>
        <p>The medical illustration likely depicts neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene located on chromosome 17. This condition affects approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals worldwide. Drake's portrait suggests erythromelangiastic rosacea, a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting the central face, though historical diagnosis remains speculative. Neurofibromatosis results from autosomal dominant inheritance with high penetrance but variable expression, while rosacea involves multiple factors including genetics, environmental triggers, and vascular abnormalities.</p>

        <h2>Pathology Signs/Signifiers of Illness</h2>
        <p>The medical illustration clearly shows the characteristic neurofibromas—benign nerve sheath tumors that appear as soft, skin-colored growths of varying sizes. The subjects display the typical distribution pattern of cutaneous neurofibromas across the torso and limbs. Drake's portrait reveals facial erythema and possible papulopustular lesions consistent with rosacea, particularly evident in the perinasal and cheek regions. The artistic medium may have enhanced or subdued certain clinical features, affecting diagnostic accuracy.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Sixteenth-century treatment options were severely limited for both conditions. Neurofibromatosis management would have been purely symptomatic, possibly involving crude surgical removal of larger tumors or herbal remedies with no proven efficacy. Rosacea treatment might have included topical applications of various botanical preparations, dietary modifications, or bloodletting based on humoral theory. Modern treatment for neurofibromatosis includes genetic counseling, surgical removal of problematic neurofibromas, and monitoring for complications. Contemporary rosacea management employs topical metronidazole, oral antibiotics, and trigger avoidance.</p>

        <h2>Social Determinants of Illness</h2>
        <p>Social determinants significantly influenced the experience and documentation of these conditions. Access to medical care, nutritional status, occupational hazards, and social support systems varied dramatically by class. Drake's maritime career exposed him to environmental factors potentially exacerbating rosacea—sun exposure, wind, dietary changes, and stress. The anonymous subjects in the medical illustration likely faced social ostracism, limited economic opportunities, and inadequate housing or nutrition, potentially worsening their conditions and limiting treatment access.</p>
